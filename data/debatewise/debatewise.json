Just recently, gas topped a $4 average nationwide. The prices are absolutely ridiculous. So, to say that a gas tax holiday is necessary and right is obviously in line with popular opinion. The problems, however, are many. First, there is no guarantee that lifting the gas tax would cause prices to actually go down. The oil companies are screwing us anyway (anyone who wants to argue that, feel free), so why wouldn\u2019t they simply keep the prices the same and pocket the extra change? Second, the gas tax is incredibly necessary. It is what provides the funds for road construction and repair.

Third (and I\u2019m sorry if this sounds elitist or unrealistic), we shouldn\u2019t be encouraging driving and gas consumption right now. Even if you don\u2019t agree that emissions are causing global warming, our dependence on oil is deadly. Foreign oil indebts us to some of the most dictatorial countries in the world. What if there was another OPEC embargo? It would devastate out economy. Furthermore, even dependence on domestic oil is dangerous, because we will run out someday. It\u2019s a non-renewable resource (unless you want to talk in terms of millennia), and the more heavily we lean on it, the harder we\u2019ll fall when it\u2019s gone.

Let us assume that there is a country with 1000 people total, with 300 of them divided equally between single females and single males within the age of childbearing but not having any children, this is 150 females and 150 males.  If these 300 individuals were to become couples at the same instant and would become immediately fertile, contributing one child to the country\u00b4s population each couple, everything else remains the same, after nine months the country would have increased to a population of 1150. Straight forward. Let us further assume that births were equally divided between girls and boys, so that in the future these contemporary individuals will come to the age were their parents were at the time this example began.  Seventy five women and men within childbearing age would contribute 75 new individuals to the total population of the country bringing the new total to 1225 under a similar scenario.   The relative rate of growth in the country\u00b4s population from the first event to the second would show a sharp decline, but nevertheless the population went up.  Over the time that went by, no one died, (after all it is just an example of my view).  If we continue with the example replicating the same scenario over time with a continuing decline in birth rates and no one dying, it will reach a point where there will be no more new additions to the population because the childbearing possibilities have been exhausted with ever decreasing childbearing couples as the scenarios take place in time.  My point is that in order to have a sustainable society, it must be capable to attain the capability to have a replacement rate that makes it viable and avoids it extinction.  Of course there are instances where this is not happening but, in a recent trip a made to Europe, it was obvious that in the near future Europe will be facing a diluted version of what I described in my example.  Many European countries have birth rates that have fallen below what makes their societies viable and are faced with the dilemma of having to support an ever increasing elderly population with fewer individuals as a result of not having had enough children. What follows I took from Wikipedia. With 82 million inhabitants in January 2010, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union. However, its fertility rate of 1.42 children per mother is one of the lowest in the world, and the federal statistics office estimates the population will shrink to between 65 and 70 million by 2060. Italy will need to raise its retirement age to 77 or admit 2.2 million immigrants annually to maintain its worker to retiree ratio. About 25% of Italian women do not have children while another 25% only have one child. The region of Liguria in northwestern Italy now has the highest ratio of elderly to youth in the world. Ten percent of Liguria's schools closed in the first decade of the 21st century. The city of Genoa, one of Italy's largest and the capital of Liguria, is declining faster than most European cities with a death rate of 13.7 deaths per 1,000 people, almost twice the birth rate, 7.7 births per 1,000 people, as of 2005."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}]}, {"url": "https://debatewise.org/debates/14957-it-is-morally-permissible-for-victims-to-use-deadly-force-as-a-deliberate-response-to-repeated-domestic-violence/", "claim_title": "It is morally permissible for victims to use deadly force as a deliberate response to repeated domestic violence", "topic": [], "perspectives_for_count": 3, "perspectives_for": [{"perspective_title": "yes it is right", "argument": {"description": ["You keep living under pressure circumstances, fact (knowing) that they can abuse you anytime anywhere is much worse than die instantly.

Wether its a broken nose, black eye, or having the mental stability of a frightened teenager for the rest of their lives.

The reality is, its not that simple. Take for example a child being abused by one of his parents while the other sits back and does nothing. I ask then, what are that child's options? He/she doesn't have the means or money to leave the situation, nor can he run away because his/her abusive parents could file missing persons and the child would be sent strait back to the abusive home. Not every person as the option to get out, therefor when the victims life is being threatened or the lives of the victims family is at stake, do you expect them to stand by and watch as they are beaten and abused?

During a six month interval following an incident of domestic violence, approximately 32% of women are victimized again.\" (Violence Prevention Center)) and we're talking repeat offenders, the person's life may very well have been or is at risk. Threatened life through violence is an evil, so it demands justice through the due punishment, which is deadly force. Not only is morally justified that the victims use deadly force to prevent more abuse, it is also justified because, quite often, victims are hunted down. Abusers commonly hunt their victims after they leave. Leaving your abuser sends them into a rage because it means they have lost temporary control over you so, when they do find you the attack will be much more severe than what normally occurs, that is also when most domestic violence deaths occur.

So the repeatedly abused is in constant danger.

However after a drug has been invented, then in the case of no patents, the company who invested into the research of the drug would have no advantage over other companies who might wish to produce that drug.

It takes a long time to develop new drugs. This is mainly because of government regulation, which requires companies to extensively test the drug before it is marketed so it would be safe for the consumers. In this case government is imposing costs on pharmaceutical companies, it would only be fair if by granting patent protection the government would allow companies to get their investments back.", "2. Stemming from the definition of the term \u201cpatent\u201d, patents enable the disclosure of innovations into the public domain for the common good. Without this protection, the inventor might prefer to keep the innovation as a secret (called a trade secret). The act of awarding a patent makes the details of the invention public, enabling further improvement by other inventors. Furthermore, being published on public records ensures that the patentee\u2019s idea won\u2019t be lost to humanity. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent#Effects]]", "3. Pharmaceutical research is high risk. When starting work on a new drug there is no ability to tell if it will succeed. Many experimental drugs don't work or have adverse side-effects, however the company still has to cover their costs. Through trial and error process, effective drugs eventually emerge, but when they are sold by the company their cost has to include the cost of the failed drugs born by the company. This is because the company has to stay afloat, pay the salaries of it's scientists, secretaries, janitors.", "4. In several industries (such as pharmaceuticals), once an invention exists, the cost of commercialization is far less than the initial cost of conception.

Considering the amount of work and money companies put into research and the social good that comes out of the development of new drugs companies have the right to spread the cost of their research over the period of the patent. Governments have to ensure this right, otherwise why should the companies be expected to develop drugs, if they can't reap the fruits of their labor? Quite simply if governments don't provide patent protection companies won't conduct research.", "We think the proposition would agree with us that patents are generally necessary and important and that companies have a right to their inventions.

But they work only when people and companies trust the government to ensure those property rights. Making a one-off exemption would undermine the government patent credibility. Making a one-off exemption would be detrimental, because companies would not necessarily perceive it as a one-off exemption. They would no longer be sure of government's legal protection of the capital that they invest into research and invention. This would be harmful to all patent industries, because people would then be afraid of investing their money into these industries.", "Even if that doesn't happen and people perceive abolishing patents only in extreme cases, it's still bad to do this. This would set a precedent for abolishing pharmaceutical patents for diseases that meet certain conditions like AIDS. These would be diseases that are life-threatening, impact a large number of people and require long-term medication. In these cases the people would expect the government to drop patent protection. Even if this motion solves the problem of AIDS, then what happens when new diseases emerge? Companies would then be unlikely to spend money on developing drugs for these dire conditions. Private companies, however, are the fastest, most efficient way of developing drugs. To explain this we have to look at alternative institutions that might develop drugs. These are government institutions and universities. If pharmaceutical research is constrained to these areas then there are three big issues that arise:", "1. Fewer types of drugs will be created.", "2. Drugs are created more slowly.", "3. There will be less upgrading for existing treatment.", "These problems all arise, because for these institutions there is no comparable incentive to private businesses. For pharmaceutical companies it is profitable to develop many different kinds of drugs and upgrade existing treatment, whereas the government will invest only enough to produce a sufficient cure, even if it isn't the best cure. This is especially problematic in the case of anti-retroviral drugs since retroviruses (like HIV) have a high rate of mutation, developing resistance to drugs very quickly, stressing the need for constant development. [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456349]] Also there is no race to drive these institutions, where as pharmaceutical companies because of the competition that exists between them have the incentive to put maximum effort into coming out with a new drug, to be the first to dominate the market.", "So disincentivizing companies to work on new life-threatening diseases, takes away our most efficient and fastest way for developing drugs. This impedes our ability to deal with health problems that arise in the future and that is harm to everybody in the world and to future generations, since everybody has the risk of contracting these diseases.", "But even if people and companies would perceive this as a one-off exemption for AIDS then it's still harmful.

So how persistent is persistent? There is need to define \u201cpersistent.\u201d It probably changes at each school though; they all have different rules and regulations. Some schools might give them the notice warning that the one who bully the other will be expelled if bullying happens again.  If bullying happens again even after giving them the second chance and at the same time offering them some kind of help such as a personal counseling, they should be expelled.  Counseling and providing them right direction to not to bully the others would not work all the time due to lack of resource or proficiency of the counselor.  There should be many other reasons that counseling might not work because the issue is complex the most of the time. And there might be another child who have been a victim of bullying and die by one's own hand during the process of counseling of those children who bully the other. Therefore, giving aggressors the second chance would be enough just for once, and they should be expelled from school after the second time.", "2.\tIt is very difficult for children who suffer from being bullied to report bullying because they are afraid of retaliation later. If there is no guarantee that aggressor will be gone from school, they would be afraid and hesitant to report the issue to school or parents and probably take no action against bullying. There should be pretty high probability that retaliation will happen after reporting bully since the attackers probably would get pretty upset if they find out that they have been reported to the school for bullying, blame the weaker, and the situation will just be worse. But if they know that those children who are bullying will be gone from school, they are more likely to report bullying because they don\u2019t have to worry about retaliation later. In one of the claims made by opposition side, somebody claims that report on a bully and she/he will come back at you worse the situation. If there is not any action taken against bullying, nothing will happen and will be changed, and children being bullied will just keep suffering from bullying and they might commit a suicide eventually. Therefore, as a result of expelling the attackers, there will be more lives saved. I am aware that defining bullying or evaluating which side is wrong or right is difficult to do. But I believe the issue of bullying is similar of the issue of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is pretty subjective; it depends on the persons who receive it. If she/he feels that she/he has been sexually harassed, it should be called sexual harassment. The same idea can be applied to bullying. If a child feels being bullied verbally or physically by the others and mentally or physically harmed, it should be called bullying. Therefore, if somebody claims that he/she has been bullied, some actions that will lead to expelling aggressor at the end should be taken.", "3.\tBeing exuded from a school would negatively affect bully\u2019s life. It is pretty severe punishment that will bring many detrimental consequences to them. It is much more severe punishment than suspension and probably the most oppressive punishment a school can give to a bully. They might have to deal with many difficulties after going though the process of expulsion and possibly going to another school. They might potentially even become a victim of bullying after joining a new school. They will have to suffer defamation of being a bully. There should be an opportunity to give them a second chance before expulsion like I stated earlier. But if the second time happens, there has to be a consequence that they have to be deal with. If there is no severe punishment, who or what will stop them from bullying? If a bully gets away with it, she/he has no incentive to change and the weaker will keep suffering from it.  Even though expelling from school will adversely affect attacker\u2019s life, they deserve it; that is the consequence of what they did. There might be wrong judgment of expelling them, but it is for protection of lives of children who are targets of bulling. A value of lives of children should be overweighed more than anything else. The harsher the punishment, bigger the effect. The harsher the punishment, there should be less possibility of bullying and another life might be saved.

One thing I have learned recently, as a result of failing miserably on a test, is that the test itself can be flawed. A little research reveals that the skills required to develop a fair, meaningful and comprehensive test, regardless of the subject matter, are considerable. Imagine for example, a mid-term exam, in this case applied mathematics, with an extremely narrow subject bandwidth, as compared with the overall course material, and limited to essentially three questions, two of which are worth 40 points each with the third worth 20 points. None were multiple choice or matching type questions. Miss just one of the 40 point questions and you get an F! To receive an A required a correct answer on 100% of the material! What does a test like this say, to me or the instructor, about what I've really learned in this class? Not much!"], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "There are too many flaws", "argument": {"description": ["Likes try to take a case in point, of mathematics class which one student takes online versus another who takes in class. Now the student in class may actually be a harder worker, smarter, an overall better student but he is challenged to the fact, that he must take the same exam as the online student, who is able to use his notes, book, online resources. So does the exam treat the student's fairly? Lets look at another fact of exams, in a generalization most classes consists of 3-4 exams, each exam covering 2-3 chapters, then a compressive final covering all chapters and of course homework. Most classes go by weighted scores, such that your exams consists of 50% of grade, your final 30% of grade, and your homework 20%. Student's put emphasis on these weighted scores, by creating priorities such that, homework is considered the bottom of the food chain. Why work on homework, when the tests are more important? When the scary realization is that homework is the tool, that provides the best way to create lasting knowledge. How do you get better at a math theory? You constantly use that math theory on dozens of problems over and over again, such as you would find on homework. However on the flip-side on a test, you memorize a theory, use it once, and forget about it. So exams fails to create lasting knowledge, which is the whole point of classes. My final point, doesn't necessarily point the flaw in examination but the flaw in the examineer. We've all had times, where a teacher would vaguely touch on subject, yet the subject becomes a big part of the test. Some teachers fail to recognize the flaws in their teaching method, as most teaching methods consists of trying to create ever lasting knowledge which takes a long time, and repetition. When tests mock the fact of this by exploiting student's who are good at the skill of learn and forget, studying whats going to be on the test, rather than knowledge provided by the teacher, which sometimes isn't even on the exam. To finish, I'd like to suggest alternatives tests that would better replace traditional exams. The best I feel would be oral exams, a one on one talk with the examiner as he goes through different questions, would eliminate exams problems that have weird worded question or ask vague questions, and then the examiner could full evaluate the person knowledge and ability use set knowledge in \"test\" sort of situation. Take home tests, are another, but cheating is an increased chance, so an implement of different tests would have to be used. The student benefits from this, for being forced to research again the knowledge that he or she has probably lost over the course. Which I think should be the true reason for a final test, a refresher on what you've learned. Also the final suggestion would be to lose the weighted score of tests, maybe making homework 50% of grade, 3-4 tests 7-10%, and the final test 20%, that way it gets rid of the one thought knowledge test. Because even a student who is copying answers, as long as he copies the method, he is learning something, such the same as a kid who copies theories from a book.

", "argument": {"description": ["After WWII, United States citizens began adopting children from other countries in large numbers. Between 1971 and 2001, America has adopted far more children internationally than any other country, more than 265,000. According to the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, international adoptions have more than doubled over the past 11 years. [[http://www.adoptioninstitute.org/FactOverview/international.html]] Adopted children come from countries all around the world. However, Guatemala, China, Russia and S. Korea make up a large majority.", "At the same time, the USA is faced with a very serious problem. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services between 1999-2006, an average of 129,884 children are in public foster care every year waiting to be adopted. [[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/afcars/waiting2006.htm]] In 2008, American couples adopted 17,229 children from abroad. This presents our government with a very grim reality. Despite the fact that literally hundreds of thousands of American born children are in need of basic care from real parents, over 17,000 couples ignored this fact and made the decision to adopt children from other counties. We firmly believe that we have a right to help all American citizens, orphans included, before we take into account problems of other nations.", "At this point, we feel the context is sufficient to state our opening argument. American citizens should be banned from adopting children internationally because currently there is great need for domestic adoption. Nowadays, there are far too many unwanted children domestically in American that need parents to adopt them. As the federal government of the USA, we have the constitutional responsibility to protect the basic rights of our citizens with a higher priority than those of other nations. As we will show below, children in foster care in America are being deprived of their basic rights of equal opportunity and pursuit of happiness. Until this problem is remedied, we cannot justify allowing American couples to meet their adoption needs abroad. As full citizens of the USA, we are determined to do everything within reason to provide these children with an equal opportunity to life a full and happy life. We also believe that adopting internationally has negative and unintended effects and may not be in the best interest of the child. We will discuss this argument in greater detail in our rebuttal.", "The foster care system in America is under critical stress and in desperate need of more couples willing to adopt. In 2004, ABC news conducted a special report on the nation\u2019s foster care system. Here are some of their findings: 520, 000 kids end up in foster care every year, costing taxpayers $40,000 a head and 22 billion dollars total every year. 40,000 infants are placed in foster care every year. 20% of these kids end up in the system for 5 years are more. But, despite these revealing statistics we saved the most important one for last: \u201cThirty percent of the homeless in America and some 25 percent of those in prison were once in foster care.\u201d \u201c [[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/Story?id=2017991&page=2]] These are the forgotten and neglected children of America. Being in foster care, they are deprived of a loving family, an essential element to living a balanced and stable life. They end up in the system for years, taken care of by adults whose only qualifications are that they can provide them with the very basic care of food and shelter. It is not surprising then that they are much more likelihood than any other demographic to end up homeless or in jail. I ask the opposition, how can we allow a single couple to adopt a baby from another country as long as this current problem exists?", "With such a supply of children needing parents to adopt them, many would wonder why so many American couples choose to adopt kids from overseas in the first place. This is, of course, is at the heart of the issue. If there is any strong opposition, it must be able to give a compelling reason why people should be allowed to adopt internationally. Based on our research, we have listed the most common reasons why people adopt as follows: There is less chance the birth parent will change their mind and try to reclaim the child legally; Less chance the biological parents will try and find their children later in life; There are too many restrictions to adopting domestically and it takes longer. While we do sympathize with these reasons, we do not find any of them compelling. The fact remains that in 2008 there was potentially 17,000 couples who could have adopted domestically but chose to go abroad instead. That means there are 17,000 kids still in the foster care system in American that doesn\u2019t need to be.", "All 17,000 of those adoption cases would likely not have happened in America. The main reason being that adoption requirements domestically are often stricter than those in other countries. These strict laws regulate and help orphans to find much more qualified parents. Many times, before adopting kids, training classes are required. For example, the state of Kansas requires that prospective parents attend Model Approach to Partnership in Parenting (MAPP) classes.

Well we think all citizens have rights, and that one of the basic rights is that to procreate.

Why, if I suddenly decide to adopt, does my choice become limited. Why do I become a tool of the state? We think placing a higher burden on those who can\u2019t naturally conceive does breach several human rights.", "Instead we think that state can and should provide basic rights such as equal opportunities through tools already mentioned, such as the CORE initiative. This places the burden upon the state itself, rather than upon a few individuals. Like wise these initiatives are open to all, rather than helping a few lucky more children get adopted.

The United States has the highest level of immigration of any country in the world. These are people who are fleeing what they believe to be a worse life in another country to come live in the US. This bad life which they had in their previous home, is probably had by many of the children in that country as well. Is it that surprising that many people who successfully get citizenship in the US then want to help others escape the poverty that they did? We don't think it's a surprise that many of the countries from which there are high adoption rates are also many of the countries from which there are high rates of immigration.", "Family members, children of close friends, many of these children have lost their parents and would domestically be an ideal case for adoption from a close friend/relative.", "Why should we deprive these children the right to escape the foster care that proposition claims is so damaging?", "We do not accept the premise that parents who adopt Internationally are doing so for convenience only. It's not the case that all of these parents would then adopt domestically. In the majority of cases you are denying the benefits of an adopted life to a child from a poor country, in favour of nothing at all. This isn't a good thing.", "Moreover why should we deny the parents the right to adopt these children? Parents shape their children so that a part of them can live on. In domestic adoption we allow for racial categorisation for example, where we try to match up children from certain racial backgrounds with similar parents. Whilst these are not absolutist rules, we see an acknowledgement that that the principle of sitting the best child with the best parent is a good one. Many parents who cannot conceive, choose to adopt an extended family member or friend from their own country. Someone they can relate to, someone they can feel justified in teaching their traditions and culture to, someone they can care about more. We think that this is a benefit which many parents are looking for, and why many choose international adoption. That not only takes me back to my point therefore that they wouldn't adopt domestically if banned from international, but also, the problems of adoption aren't solved by finding lots of homes, but by finding suitable homes.

To do this properly, we need to consider the fundamental role of intelligence agencies in our society. We have a number of questions that need to be answered before the debate could be developed further.", "First, why do we need intelligence agencies and what do they do?", "Second, what methods do they employ?", "Third, what are the differences of powers of intelligence agencies among different countries and why do they arise?", "Fourth, when and why do we allow the use of some intelligence evidence in the court of law?", "Fifth, what are the reasons of prohibiting the use of certain kind of evidence?", "Common sense suggests us that the main reason of creating intelligence agencies is to collect information to ensure national security. Intelligence agencies are used for strengthening the states by preventing internal and external threats. Intelligence agencies track down huge organized crime. They are involved in prevention of terrorism. They are given rights to collect information which sometimes infringe on the rights of privacy for the reason that the overall benefit for the society and the state is simply greater.", "For achieving their goals, the agencies employ a number of methods. The main methods include espionage, cryptanalysis, interception of communication, etc. This collection of information entails a certain level of intrusion into private lives of individuals. The intrusion to private lifes happens at the point when agencies actually listen to the conversations or make other secretive actions. The disclosure of the information later on bears little relevance to the action - the information had been collected already. The harm, if any, is already done and there is little reason not to use the evidence we already have. Instead, the whole purpose of collecting evidence is to be able to use it later on for prevention or for conviction of criminals. Gathering intelligence but not using it infringes on privacy while not benefiting us too much, since the criminals cannot be convicted.", "Ultimately, the methods that can be employed by intelligence agencies depend on the legislation of a country. We believe that the methods of surveillance that can be used to a large extent depend on the society and what power they are willing to give to intelligence agencies. For instance, after an increasing number of terrorist attacks there has been a lot of pressure from the people to actually increase security measures although some freedom would have to be forsaken to achieve that greater security. The Guantanamo Bay example shows that there is substantial negative attitude towards intelligence agencies pushing too far; the people condemn torture and find it repugnant in a free society. So we think that in modern democracies it is the society which is somewhat able to put the limits to how far intelligence agencies can go.", "The reasons for the use of intelligence evidence in the courts of law are quite apparent. The evidence is simply relevant to the cases and can influence the decisions, convicting criminals and terrorists. This will be developed later in our case.", "Finally, so what are the reasons of prohibiting the use of certain kind of evidence? Once we accept the notion that some kind of evidence collected by intelligence agencies is admissible in the courts of law because of its relevance to the case, the reason for excluding a certain type of evidence must be a fundamental difference between the two types of evidence. For instance, the UK prohibits the use of intercept evidence. On the other hand, it allows eavesdropping. To prove that the prohibition must be kept in place either a) the fundamental difference between two cases should be proven; or b) it should be proven that the use of any evidence collected by intelligence agencies should be prohibited.", "Usually it is contended that the most fundamental difference between, say, intercept evidence and more open methods of surveillance is the extent of intrusion into personal privacy. Here we would like to develop a case that any difference is a) weak, b) completely arbitrary. Here we want to continue taking the UK as the example. The legislation is quite confusing. The law forbids the use of intercepted evidence (mails, telephone calls) in courts of law. However, it allows evidence collected by eavesdropping[[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000023_en_1]]. Conceptually, we see no difference as in both cases the individual is unaware that he is under surveillance. Say, there is a bug in the room. Two persons talk to each other. In another situation they talk with the phone while being intercepted. The substance here is the same: two people exchanging information under an expectation that nobody else hears them. The substance here is more important than the form. The fundamental difference is weak indeed, if any. The legislation is even more confusing. In the UK, any intercept evidence gathered by foreign intelligence is fully admissible or, for instance, interception in mental hospitals is admissible too. We see that the distinction between the cases is rather arbitrary.", "Sometimes it is claimed that people might be framed by intelligence agencies by revealing only a part of evidence and taking it out of context. However, if that is true, the intelligence agencies can take information out of context in any case \u2013 it does not matter whether it would be interception or a direct conversation. This is why some checks on balances on the whole system are needed. For instance, this is why we have a separation of intelligence agency and the court in the first place \u2013 to ensure more fairness."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Our plan does not create additional incentives to gather information using illegal means", "argument": {"description": ["Our plan might raise a question of whether the intelligence agencies will have more incentives to gather the information using illegal means once all evidence is admissible in courts of law. We believe that any perverse incentives created by the plan are negligible, and here\u2019s why.", "Under our plan the collection using illegal means remains prohibited in the first place. If intelligence agencies gathered evidence using illegal means and presented it at the court, obviously we would use the evidence due to its relevance. At the same time, the intelligence agency would be liable for breaking the law and would have to bear the consequences of their action according to the legislation. It is essential to realize that intelligence agencies should be very reluctant to admit that they had been gathering intelligence using illegal means.", "First, it is a direct damage to them due to becoming liable for their actions. Second, prestige is of key importance to these institutions. Once the fact that illegal methods were used for intelligence purposes is known publicly, the society would put huge pressure on the institutions because of illegitimacy of their actions. That is likely to result in a change of the main officials and also the decrease in the powers of intelligence agencies. Hence, we can see that due to incentives not to use the illegally obtained information, intelligence agencies would be willing to use illegal means no more than they are at the moment."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Our plan does not jeopardize the collection of intelligence", "argument": {"description": ["Another issue we want to address is a possible reduction in efficiency in agencies\u2019 ability to gather information. In particular, we consider two problems. First, disclosure of evidence in courts might lead to disclosure of information gathering methodology. Second, sensitive information might be disclosed.", "Presenting evidence in courts indirectly reveals how the agency collected that information. For example, if the evidence is a transcription of a telephone conversation, then it tells that phone conversations were intercepted.  We here can make a reasonable assumption that members of organized crime (and especially terrorists) already know that their cell phones might be tracked, that their internet chats recorded, and virtually all information they exchange can in principle be investigated by an intelligence agency. Knowing that, criminals use increasingly sophisticated means of communication and coordination, but motivation to upgrade their means of communication has little in connection with intelligence info being disclosed in courts. Even if keeping the intelligence gathering methods in secrecy has any value, there is a number of other ways how to learn about these methods. A lot of countries already use most of the evidence in courts of law (for instance, intercept evidence is admissible in the US, Canada). Besides, Discovery Science, Google, and criminal friends are also quite good resources of information about possible methods of interception.", "The second issue is that sensitive information might be disclosed. As we have outlined in the plan, in order to preserve public interest immunity, information that could harm chances of successful investigation of the question at hand or would have broader implications for the public would not be revealed by the discretion of the responsible authority. For instance, in drug trafficking cases evidence against a middle-man would not be used if it would potentially reveal existence of undercover agents - prevention of nation-wide drug distribution is a far more important. We simply keep this common practice unchanged.", "Our plan does not really endanger the ability of intelligence agencies to gather intelligence, nor it discloses all sensitive information. On the contrary, our plan is more flexible than the status quo. Under the status quo, certain types of evidence are explicitly inadmissible in the statutes of a country. We say that this is rather rigid. We believe that once we deal with threats as big as terrorism, it is rather myopic to apply one-size-fits-all approach. We think that a judge or another relevant authority can best decide whether it is worth to risk disclosing the methods of gathering intelligence or not, because they can take into account the circumstances which were not thought about when making the law. In the very end, this leads to better outcomes."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "More evidence in courts of law would help to fight terrorism and organized crime", "argument": {"description": ["The plan would increase the available pool of information that can be used in courts of law. In the times of actual threat of terrorism, intelligence agencies gather much information. With the introduction of the Patriot Act in the US after 9/11, increased scope of action for Australian intelligence after bombings in Bali, strengthened intelligence in Spain after terror acts in Madrid, and other cases, intelligence agencies have information that can and should be used as evidence. We believe that it is clear that more sources of information that is relevant to the cases can only lead to more correct decisions in the court. More evidence can help both the prosecuting side and the defendant, thus the likelihood that the court will arrive to correct decision would increase.", "Let us elaborate more on correct conclusions. For example, drug lords are very hard to prosecute, because without information obtained by intercepting communication channels, using bugs to record sound, and infiltrating people into organization the cases can hardly be solved.", "Moreover, if we do not allow intelligence information to be used in courts, we might end up in situations where criminals caught right before committing a felony can be accused of little more than illegal possession of weapons. Terrorist organization, plotting a new 9/11, could not be prosecuted since the evidence is not admissible in the courts of law.", "We see that intelligence information is generally helpful in many cases. There are plenty of instances where intelligence evidence was of some help for convicting criminals. For instance, convicting the people who wanted to blow up commercial airliners several weeks ago[[http://www.planetdata.net/sites/intelligence/news.php?story=25819]].

Boxing gloves are 10-12 ounces.  In the UFC you're hit approximately 40 times in 3 or 5 rounds.  In boxing you're hit hundreds of times in 10 rounds.  In the UFC a fight is determined  by submission, judges decision, but rarely by knock out.  Boxing is typically won by knockout and sometimes judges decision.  UFC is fought in a tall octagon cage so that fighters can not fall out, be thrown out or be cornered in.  Boxers have fallen out of rings, been tossed out of rings and get cornered so it's harder to defend themselves and get out of the corners.  In the UFC once a fighter is knocked out the fight is immediately over.  In boxing a fight can continue after a fighter is knocked out as long as they're back up within 10 seconds.  Typically, they're knocked out for a few seconds and the fight resumes.

Workers can earn up to 570 paid days off a year (that's no typo - we know there are only 365 days a year - Swedes can earn more paid days off than days they actually work). So where are the poor, crazy, reckless people of Sweden?

Some High School students teach Elementary school, while Colleges teach what Swedish High Schools did 15 years ago, showing the recent decline in the quality of Swedish education.

The reason for this is because it is of such importance to keep 11 men on a field in a sport that generates so much money every decision could be harmful or beneficial so getting that right decision is crucial as there are questions to be answered on the field at times ones which will need clearing up for example what if a player dives and gets a player sent off at a crucial stage of the game ? should the referee send the player off? what did the referee see? how far away was he ? should he make a panicked decision with 10 players around him shouting at him ? or should he blow his whistle and signal a square with his hands and ask a panel of expert official\u2019s watching the evidence to make the right and fair call?.", "One argument against which I have heard is the time which will be taken to do so and that it would add too much time to a game and eventually slow the football match down too much.

Until now, most countries have engaged in a neck-to-neck competition to consume as much resources as possible in order to achieve quick development, and common thought was that such governments were immune from facing the consequences of their rampant pollution. However, this sanction shows a fundamental change in attitude; by making it clear that the global community such as the UN will not allow for quick profits made in the expense of the environment, we establish that the simple principle that pollution is unacceptable, and that the polluter will have to pay for whatever harms he/she inflicts upon rest of the world.

The argument that people move from villages to cities following terrorist attacks is incorrect. In fact, it should ideally be the other way round. The aim of a terrorist attack is to have the maximum impact and create fear. This can be done by attacking a major city, rather than a remote village. For example, all recent terrorist activities in India have been carried out in the major cities of New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune etc. The proposition also submits that people who move to cities do not have their required documents and are therefore denied jobs. This argument is completely baseless. What sort of logic dictates that just because a person is from a village he/she does not possess their documents?", "The second point raised is that there should be psychological compensation and something called 'compensation of truth'. If by this the proposition means that the government should hold the hands of the victims of a terrorist attack, it is absurd to the point of hilarity. All governments condemn attacks of this nature. The persons behind these acts are caught and justice is done. Our most worthy opponents fear that the population will hide in a little dark corner being depressed for the rest of their lives. This is a baseless argument. There are examples of widows of police officers who died in the Mumbai massacre who have led marches and protests, demanding that the terrorists be brought to book. This requires great mental strength", "Also, it is yet again submitted that the proposition is not at all clear in its definition of 'compensation'.

As well as demanding a concerted effort to strengthen national security and resilience mechanisms, sustainable success requires that a central focus is similarly placed upon defeating and dismantling extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and continuing to deny their operatives safe havens within unstable regions such in Afghanistan and the federally administered tribal areas of Pakistan.   Due to the pervasive nature of insurgent activity within the region, the stabilization of Afghanistan increasingly demands a concerted counterinsurgency (COIN) effort to secure key population centres and prevent extremist groups from gaining momentum in their attempts to expand their spheres of influence.  For COIN to be successful within the current Afghanistan campaign, international efforts must employ a fully comprehensive strategy that encapsulates a coordinated and unified effort amongst all the actors involved. This must span an encompassing spectrum of political, military and economic capabilities.", "A comprehensive approach has therefore not yet been fully adopted as there is a disproportionate emphasis upon the military aspect of the campaign and short fallings in, and militarisation of both civil capacity building and economic development efforts, as well as a lacking unity of effort and overall unity of command amongst the multiple dimensions of international contributions which intersect every level of the stabilisation effort in the region.  For the comprehensive approach to be fully realised, greater balance between the pillars must be achieved if international efforts are to be successful in neutralising the insurgency, dismantling Al-Qaeda, preventing the return of Afghanistan to Taliban control, and ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become a sanctuary for radical Islamists and a training ground for further terrorist attacks against the west.", "The emphasis must therefore be on the political effort as the continued asymmetric focus upon the military dimension will create further fragility, instability and insecurity.  Furthermore, a politically unified front must be maintained where the military effort is but one of multiple efforts under an overall coordinated and unified command.  Otherwise, shortcomings in the adoption of a comprehensive approach will continue to have significant repercussions which will further hinder regional stabilization.  This will further impact upon the ability of the international community to address key grievances within Afghanistan and ensure that legitimate governance is maintained, as well as its ability to successfully train Afghan security forces and enable Afghanistan to provide security to its citizens and overcome the excessive levels of corruption that are deep rooted within every level of Afghanistan\u2019s national infrastructure. This kind of approach must draw upon the lessons learnt from previous COIN campaigns both inside and outside of Afghanistan and should involve greater harmonisation between civil capacity building and economic development efforts as well as among different national military contributions, where the military effort should be refocused into a lighter, smaller force concentrated on the more narrowly defined task of counter terrorism.", "This should compliment a bottom-up approach to responsible governance where stability is first established at a provincial level rather than nurturing attempts to facilitate stability from a top-down state level.  Such efforts should be firmly rooted within the context of a wider regional emphasis upon stabilisation, particularly in relation to Pakistan, and should focus upon fostering an environment where the Afghans are in the lead and it becomes clear to the world that the international community is willing and prepared to commit to a long term involvement in resourcing and securing the stabilisation of the region.

Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times.

First, one has to draw a boundary in the sea between Scotland and England to decide who gets which oil and gas fields. This is likely to prove mighty difficult. Nevertheless, our study chose the most plausible line. Second, the tax revenues also come from gas fields and, on average, less than 40% of gas production is in Scottish waters.\"", "In the second article I draw your attention to the following:", "\"Helen Pickering of Portsmouth University says that other boundary disputes have thrown up lots of reasons for deviating from an equidistant line.

There are also movements within the Orkney and Shetland Islands, which have not always been part of Scotland, to declare independence and grab some oil themselves.

If Scotland did separate from the UK, the division of North Sea oil revenues is in no way, shape or form, as easy as the nationalists would like to argue.

More production results in higher wealth of the people \u2013 each of us gets more goods and services than he used to get before. Hence, savings are essential for economic growth, as they work as a base for starting the cycle of the growth to prosperity.

To sum up, wealth accumulation ensures that a society will be able to get more productive, and will not get poorer when the existing capital depreciates.", "The second positive effect of wealth accumulation is the ability to sustain during tough economic times. Knowing that the \"crisis examples\" are very popular these times, we can't help but bring up one. If one looks into the Baltic states, where the economic downturn was one of the most severe in the world [[http://www.wtnrradio.com/story.php?story=361]], she would notice that the propensity to save was very low, if not negative in this region. There was not real wealth accumulation, it was a consumption-based world. Thus, when the income went down and the lending bubble busted, the societies in the region suffered \"quite a significant\" shock . There was no wealth accumulated to help absorbing the shock.  Now, if one looks into the countries least affected by the crisis (same article as above) - it's Qatar,  Yemen, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. One can easily guess why they were least affected - they had a lot of wealth accumulated from the oil exports. That wealth serves as a pillow to soften the downturn. Of course, the wealth from inheritance will never provide an effect of the same significance as does the wealth from oil exports due to difference in accumulation period and the magnitude itself, but the core principle is the same.", "To conclude, we have shown that inheritance taxes lower wealth accumulation through two channels - propensity to save and direct wealth conversion to spendings. Then, we analyzed the effects of wealth accumulation to the economy, and showed that it both provides a base for sustainable economic growth and ensures that economies are not hit very hard during downturns. Thus, we conclude that abolishment of inheritance taxes will lead to sustainable economic growth which, after all, is one of the main goals for any government."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Equality of opportunity cannot be the leading principle in deciding upon inheritance in our society", "argument": {"description": ["It is usually contended that equality of opportunity is an admirable objective and should be pursued in our society.

Why should you be wealthier just because you were lucky enough to be born in a prosperous family? \u2013 That is the rhetoric that usually comes from proponents of inheritance tax.

It has been successful for many years, expanding at a rapid pace. The owner was happy to finance the expansion with retained earnings \u2013 but now he finds himself in trouble, because in case of his death, his son would not be able to pay without selling a share of his business.

If it were so, we could tax any arbaitrarily chosen things, for instance, daily sun exposure of the riches. There should be some underlying principles according to which we base our decision on what a tax has to be put. If the opposition wants to tax inheritance, they should be able to give some very good reasons why exactly inheritance and not other arbitrary processes such as sunbathing should be taxed or why it is superior to simply increasing the rate of income tax. Throughout the debate we did not manage to hear any single reason for this.", "Because we think that taxing inheritance is not fair, we oppose it on moral grounds. We believe that the mechanism of inheritance taxation is fundamentally wrong. In its essence, it is a tax on a gift from one individual to another. We do not think that the state has to right to intervene into family and start demanding its part whenever a something is passed on between family members. It sets a bad example \u2013 the state shows that it does not care about family as a unit. The tax infringes the basic liberties of an individual \u2013 the right to free will and the right to dispose one\u2019s property in a way he wishes to. It limits the ability of people to pursue happiness through taking care of their relatives, guaranteeing economic safety to their children or making sure that their established business is going to be givent into good hands after their death.", "We say that inheritance tax is most certainly different from other taxes. Say, income tax is paid in proportion to your income, which is a proxy for the usage of public goods that have to be provided by the government. These taxes are needed, because people have to pay for the infrastructure of the state, legal system \u2013 the basic public goods that they actually use. We do not think that the same applies to inheritance tax \u2013 it is simply a tax on income that had been taxed previously.", "The only reason opposition has presented in the debate was that the tax helps to redistribute wealth. Instead, we can say quite certainly that the tax does not really help wealth redistribution.", "First, we often tax capital-rich, but income-poor people. When an old pensioner with no income, but with a valuable house, is subject to inheritance tax, his children are likely to wind up in an unpleasant situation where they will have to sell the property just to pay the tax. The numbers of these cases are just increasing as the property prices are growing. Second, the real income-rich people have more potential to avoid the tax \u2013 they simply have money to hire lawyers who would help finding loopholes in legislation. However, it is not so easy for capital-rich and income-poor people: neither they have the money to hire legal advisors, nor they have the expertise and time to do it themselves.", "Finally, from administrative point of view, it would be much easier to increase the income tax rate and collect revenues from there. No additional institutions would be created; wasteful spending on administrating the tax would be limited. Income tax is more difficult to avoid \u2013 then there would be no need to create such taxes as gift tax for preventing evasion and there would be no need to administer them, too. In fact, the whole case of the opposition falls apart when we look at what part of budget usually inheritance tax constitutes (usually less than 2% of a country\u2019s budget). When we sum up administrative costs and indirect costs (people trying to avoid taxes instead of creating value), the actual contribution to the budget is ridiculous. A useful tip: if opposition likes random taxes which are there just for the sake of taxing the rich, they can also try to implement some other taxes: taxing their daily word usage or the number of countries they visit during a year. Then they could use the revenues to, in their words, make society function in a useful way.", "Finally, there are numerous practical economic reasons for abolition.", "One problem of inheritance taxation is that it has a negative effect on wealth accumulation in our society. The money is not saved, but instead consumed, because individuals substitute from savings to consumption. This leads to a lower capital accumulation, which is the basis of all economic activity because it provides means for production. As a result of lower capital base, the overall economic growth is reduced in the long run. Opposition pointed out that it is applicable to all taxes, because they all reduce the disposable income of an individual. While we certainly agree that they decrease income, it is also obvious that not all of them decrease incentives to save. When, for instance, income tax is applied, individual\u2019s income decreases, but he does not get any further disincentive to save, because the earnings will stay in his or his heir\u2019s disposal. However, once he is taxed with an inheritance tax, he has an incentive to consume that wouldn\u2019t have been there without the tax. This is what troubles us economically and the opposition was very myopic to claim that this tax is no different than any other taxes.", "Another economic problem with inheritance taxes is that they reduce entrepreneurial activity. Because of the costs imposed when the risk of owner\u2019s death increases, businesses will invest less to avoid possible financial distress. This will cause poorer employment prospects, less growth and less value-added. As simple as it gets. Please, note how desperate the opposition was in attempting to rebut our argument \u2013 this is too good to be left out. The notion that there are many reasons why small businesses fail and, because of this, estate tax should not be taken seriously is utterly absurd. This is equivalent to claiming that just because there are 10 factors causing cancer, nutrition or clean environment become not important. One of the flaws that opposition makes in its reasoning is that it takes means and medians as support for their illustrative case. In our argument we already agreed that inheritance tax is not the major problem in every instance. What we were discontent with were various special cases where circumstances were far from average situation. For instance, American Family Business Institute has a collection of such stories[[http://www.nodeathtax.org/resources/testimonies]]. The opposition claimed that they can use the money to support other social programs and other businesses. Well, you can also attempt to create perfect income equality, but as we know, this is just not so good in creating wealth, is it? The opposition thinks it is perfectly fine to take money out of functional profitable businesses just for the sake of some vague opportunity. Disincentive to invest is called a bogeyman by them \u2013 as a proof for this we get a quote which carries no relevance to investment incentives, in fact, it is about increase in value of estates not being taxed. Finally, the opposition doubted the validity of our cited study. To be honest, we also doubt it. There are no studies that would be perfect \u2013 and you never know anything with 100% confidence, and this is especially true for social sciences. We gave our economic reasoning, and we also gave some scientific evidence to confirm it (and there are many papers that confirm similar results[[http://www.nodeathtax.org/resources/studies]]). Opposition merely tried to deny our evidence while never tackling our argumentation and this is where they failed.", "Abolishing inheritance taxation would strengthen the incentives to create value and use the wealth in a sustainable manner.

He twice escaped from county jails before his final apprehension in February 1978. After more than a decade of vigorous denials, he eventually confessed to over 30 murders, although the actual total of victims remains unknown. Estimates range from 29 to over 100, the general estimate being 35. Typically, Bundy would bludgeon his victims, then strangle them to death. He also engaged in rape and necrophilia.

One of these ways is by using convicted felons to do hard labor and other types of jobs that are beneficial to the state that is caring for them. Prisoners who are convicted to death are in the special circumstance that the state has already made the decision that they will forfeit their life. This debate is not about whether or not it is right for the state to make this decision. Therefore, we have a special sample group that can be utilized for medical testing as we have stated previously.

To treat death row prisoners with nonconsensual medical experiment, with unknown potential harm and risk to them, is such a cruel and inhuman punishment without applying any legal process to justify this action. It's absolutely degrading as the prisoners are treated as animals or mere objects without consent, basically a convenient human guinea pig. Any civilized society should not allow this cruel punishment happen because it goes against the fundemental basis of that society, which is the respect and protection of liberty, rights and freedom as a citizen. All across the world or even history there's rules against cruel and unusual punishment. As early as it written in Bill of Rights by King Williams III and Queen Mary II in 1687, and as wide as it adopted in article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of UN General Assembly in 1948. Similar articles appear in European Convention of Human rights in 1950 and Charter of the Fundemental Human Rights of EU in 2000.

To treat death convicts as objects of experiment WITHOUT their consent across this line and should not be uphold as means to real justice, for however noble ends the proposition sides claims. A vaccine should be developed and acquired under legal experiments with the consent of volunteers. Save life should not be based through tramping life and the legal rights such a life possess.

First of all, the opposition understands from the beginning that the case is set in the US and limited to death-penalized prisoners for pandemic vaccines. What we are trying to show is that the plan not only hurts the legal rights of prisoners but also the justice of a civilized society, while the proposition didn't address anything in their first argument why legally or morally this model stands. All they tried to convey in their first point is that medical vaccine is important and urgent for possible pandemic outbreak. We say by just stating the urgency of the need of vaccine(which we don't deny) doesn't give any direct legal justification about why the prisoners should be targetted as the subjects, and especially, when this could done without their consent. It is worth emphasizing that that the opposition never argue that prisoners should be totally excluded in the medical experiment, what we concern and believe is the key issue here is that why the state has the absolute right to force them doing so without their consent. We don't think the propositon mentioned this point at all in their opening phrase.", "2. Also, we don't quite understand when the proposition side said and I quote here: \"we are glad that the oppositon side stands at our side for the first time.\" As much as we share the same compassion of medical research for pandemic disease, we at no time agrees that the extra cruel and unusual punishment should be imposed on death-row prisoners. We stand for a civilized society with the rule of justice and law, that even in death penalty, which occurs in rarest cases, should be conducted in a compassionate way, while the proposition seems to assume that the government automatically have the right to do so no matter what. But seeing the rebuttal we are very glad that the proposition side for the first time listed out the right of prisoners, a point we pleasantly take as now understood by both sides: prisoner DO have rights. This is a good place to start. The difference is that prop trying to seperate the rights of innocent than convicts, but a more important question to answer here is not that do the convicts different from the innocent? but do we have the right to make them different? In other words, could we deprive people's natural right just because they are convicted?  Certain rights are born with that nobody or nothing can take it away. They are so basic that cease to be utalitarian. The prop side trying to infringe the natural right of the death-row prisoners using the absolute state power, the opp firmly against it as it not only bladently discriminate equal born right but also imposing cruel punishment. In the case of the medical experiment, it's the basic right of the convicts to have informed consent. They should be informed about the potential harm and risk, and have the final say for whether to sacrifice their personal autonomy over body or health for the experiment. If they agrees to do so then it's fine but if they don't agree, there's no legal ground to impose a government action. Otherwise it's called cruel and unusual punishemnt that does not fly with the justice system. The government can end their life by a bullet or wheelchair through legal procesure, but can not randomly inject unknown substance to their body which might lead to unknown result. We firmly believe such a basic right of consent for experiment can not be taken away for all citizens, innocent or convicts. Like mentioned, basic rights are natural that they stop to be utalitarian. We can not infringe people's basic human rights for the so called-greater good, whether it's small or big group, majority or minority, rich or poor, warm-hearted volunteers or death-row prisoners--no one or nothing could make the right different.", "3. Plus, we understand that you are focusing on death-row prisoners. However, by talking about other prisoners or the whole society doesn't ignore the notion of the debate. What we wanna to talk about is the impact to justice system and society from a big picture. It's quite relevant to consider how other stakeholders like other prisoners or the society would be influenced by the policy you proposed. The impact is that this further people's antagonism to criminals, not just death-row prisoners but all prisoners as a whole, or even worse the antaganism between society and criminals, because a society that allow the death-row prisoners to be experimented like rabbits or guinea pigs clear don't carry out much thought about their rights. Further discrimination from the public might deepen and criminals would be further marginalized by this policy. This would decrease the rehabilitative function of justice, meaning prisoners as a whole would be harder to be reformed or accepted by society when having a chance to go back to society. Yet rehabilitation is a key principle justice should seek to uphold. As civilization develops, our society should move beyond the form of retributive justice, having less violent to violent punishment but aiming to reforming more and more people. Unfortunately, the prop's model wouldn't achieve these goals of real justice at all because it aims at infringing prisoner's rights and bring more backlash to the justice system. A society with the \"great good\" achieved in this way would not go far, and not a civilized one to be praised for.", "Besides, the prop failed to address the principle of retributive justice. A basic rule is that the punishment need to fit for crime. For death-penalized prisoners, the death itself is already the punishment.

From 2005\u20132008, he won every French Open, defeating Federer each time (2005 semi-final and 2006\u20132008 finals), and won at least 2 of the 3 clay Masters events each year from 2005\u20132010, defeating Federer in 6 of those. As a result, some analysts and players, such as Pat Cash and Conchita Mart\u00ednez, already consider Nadal the greatest clay-court player ever.[52] Nadal has won all of their seven meetings in best of five set matches on clay.", "Hard", "Federer and Nadal have each won 4 of their 8 matches on hard courts. Federer has been the best hard court player since 2004, winning 9 of the 15 hard court Grand Slams and 5 of the 8 Masters Cups, plus a record at Cincinnati. Nadal has always had solid results on hard courts, winning 9 tournaments since 2005, including five Masters Series. But he has improved considerably over the years, reaching the semifinals of both Grand Slams for the first time in 2008, winning the 2008 Olympics Singles tournament, defeating Federer in the Australian Open final in early 2009, and winning the US Open for the first time in 2010.", "Despite Nadal's success on hard courts, some analysts have criticized his lack of consistency in reaching tournament finals for skewing the overall head-to-head results. They contend that more hard court encounters, especially in the early years of the rivalry, would likely have resulted in a better winning percentage for Federer.[14][53]", "Federer has been more successful than Nadal on hard courts because he hits a flatter forehand and has a bigger serve. Hard courts are a fast surface, so Federer's flatter shots result in a lower bouncing, faster moving trajectory. Thus, Nadal's topspin is least effective on hard courts, because it doesn't bounce up as high to Federer's backhand, enabling Federer to return it better. Nadal has improved his serving speed and placement over the years, but Federer still serves faster on average and earns more aces and service winners.[54]", "Grass", "As with clay, Federer and Nadal have been the two best players on grass for the last 5 years. Federer has been the preeminent grass player since 2003, winning 5 consecutive Wimbledons from 2003 to 2007. Nadal has steadily improved on grass, playing Federer in three consecutive Wimbledon finals from 2006\u20132008, with better results each time. Since 2003, Federer and Nadal have swept the Wimbledon title, Federer in 2003-'07, 2009 and Nadal in 2008 & 2010.One of the reasons for Nadal's success is that in recent years Wimbledon management has firmed up their courts to make them more durable. Some say this has created the side-effect that the new courts play slower.[55][56] Still, however, grass is considered the fastest surface. While Nadal is supposedly weaker on faster surfaces, the lack of a true bounce on both clay and grass may be the true secret to why Nadal is better on grass and clay than on hard court. Nadal has won on the very surface at the Olympics (identical to the US Open surface) and he has won the Australian Open (thought to be a slower hard court surface, but still much faster than clay) the US Open (the faster hard courts) and he has won several Masters Series in both the Spring and Summer.", "The fact that they have played three matches on grass is remarkable considering that the Wimbledon final has been their only opportunity to do so in recent years. The grass season is brief, with only two weeks between the end of the French Open and the beginning of Wimbledon every year. This means that both men play just one other grass tournament, but they have always entered different events. Additionally, from 2006 onwards, both men have entered the Wimbledon draw as the top 2 seeds, meaning that they can only meet in the final each time.", "Relationship and competitive dynamic", "Both Federer and Nadal's personal and professional relationship is good-natured and gracious.[57] Though they are both highly competitive, they maintain a healthy regard for each other and have had virtually no source of personal animosity. The lone issue, albeit minor, was Federer's complaint about Nadal's slow, deliberate style of play on the eve of the 2008 Wimbledon final.[58]", "Despite their cordial relationship, both men have a somewhat different attitude towards their rivalry. When Federer was securely atop the tennis world he was ambivalent towards the notion of a rivalry with an opponent five years younger than himself.[59][60] But after their memorable 2008 Wimbledon final he had no choice but to acknowledge its significance, even admitting \"it definitely becomes more and more special the more times we play against each other.\"[60] A few weeks later, after Nadal had officially surpassed him in the rankings, Federer offered this compliment: \"Look at what he had to achieve to get it. That's what I like to see.\"[61] Nadal has always cherished the rivalry because he looks up to Federer as both a role model and a measuring stick for success.[62][63]", "When interest in their rivalry increased, however, both Federer and Nadal collaborated to arrange occasional charity exhibition matches to benefit their charities' philanthropic interests. The most recent was the Match for Africa, played on 21 December 2010 in Zurich, Switzerland (Federer won 4-6, 6-3, 6-3) and a follow-up match played in Madrid on the following day, titled \"Joining Forces for the Benefit of Children\" (Nadal won 7\u20136 (7\u20133), 4\u20136, 6\u20133).", "Cultural impact", "The rivalry has also increased overall interest in tennis. The highly-anticipated 2008 Wimbledon final drew strong television ratings for tennis in both the U.S. and across Europe.[13][64] The match was also featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which was the first time in years that tennis made the cover.[", "Skill comparisons", "\u201c\tI am more than happy with my titles, and I think talk about if I am better or worse than Roger is stupid because the titles say he's much better than me, so that's the truth at that moment. I think that will be true all my life.[66]\t\u201d", "Federer has been considered by many to be the greatest tennis player of all time.[67] Some, however, argue that despite Federer's record 16 Grand Slam titles, he should not be considered the greatest ever with an 8-17 record against Nadal. Others analyze the head-to-head matches by surface and conclude that Nadal's edge comes from his 12-2 record against Federer on clay. Federer has achieved the majority of his success on grass (6 Wimbledon titles) and hardcourts (5 US Open titles and 4 Australian Open titles), whereas Nadal has achieved his greatest success on clay (6 French Open titles). It is argued that the fact that the majority of their matches have been on Nadal's most successful surface and Federer's least successful demonstrates that Federer has long been the second best clay court player in the world to Nadal. Nadal is regarded by many as the greatest clay court player of all time. He also has been a member of multiple Spanish Davis Cup teams, which Federer has never accomplished. Both men have an Olympic gold medal - Nadal in singles and Federer in doubles.", "During interviews, people like fellow player Andy Murray and former player and coach Paul Annacone have called Nadal one of the best tennis players ever.[68] In November 2010, Bjorn Borg said that Federer is the greatest player, but \"Rafa has the chance to be the greatest player\" if he stays healthy. John McEnroe said, \"there is an argument to be made that Rafael Nadal may be the greatest player eventually, even possibly now.\"[69] In response to a question posed by a journalist at the 2010 French Open regarding whether Nadal is better than Federer, Nadal replied, \"I think this person don't know nothing about tennis.\" The journalist asked why, and Nadal told the journalist, \"so you don't know nothing about tennis. You see the titles of him and you see the titles of me? It's no comparison. So that's the answer. Is difficult to compare Roger with me now, because he has 16 Grand Slams; I have 6. Masters 1000, yeah, I have more than him. But for the rest of the things the records of Roger is very, very almost impossible to improve.\"[70][71] At the press conference following his semi-final win in the 2010 U.S. Open Nadal was asked whether his head-to-head advantage over Federer means he is better. Nadal replied, \"Head to head is not an element for me.

Reading government\u2019s case one could get a false impression that evil bankers exploit consumers and charge as high interest rates as possible. Sure, conspiracies are fun, but this is very far from reality. In essence, interest rate reflects transfer of consumption possibilities over time. If you want to consume now although you do not have the wealth now, you have to borrow against your future income. In frictionless world, that would be it. Since there are risks involved in our world, there are premiums that have to be charged additionally. For instance, when a borrower can default, she will be charged a premium. Let\u2019s take an example. As a lender, you want to have a real return of 5%. You lend 100 dollars for a person with no probability of default with 5% interest rate, because expect her to repay with 100% confidence \u2013 and in the end the interest rate will bear you 5% real return. However, if a person has a 50% probability of defaulting, you have to lend to her 100 dollars with 110% interest rate! Because 210 dollars taking into account the 50% probability to get them is exactly 105 dollars. Additionally, there could be other premiums \u2013 for example, for inflation or currency risk. If we take a look at current economic conditions, the interest rates are high because they reflect high liquidity risk. Banks hoard liquid assets, because they are afraid that too many borrowers will default, leaving the bank illiquid. So, risk is essential in determining the interest rate for a loan and even the proposition acknowledged that (\"banks are ... a collection of self-interested bankers who make personal profit from giving out high-risk high-interest rate loans.\"). Now what ensures that bankers do not charge any arbitrary amount for their loans? Competition! Banks and other institutions compete very much against each other to offer the best possible deals for the customers \u2013 the deals which would still be profitable for them in the end and would cover their cost of capital.", "The most possible consequence of the cap on interest rates is loans not being given for people who would have more than 20% rate. On the side of the proposition there was an assertion that \u201cOur policy will, at most, influence the SIZE of the loans and the frequency of BAD loans\u201d. The assertion is completely out the blue and was not supported with any reasoning why it should influence only these things. And we have quite strong evidence to believe otherwise, and here\u2019s why.  You don\u2019t have to be a genius to figure out that loans with very high interest rates are given for people who cannot report any source of income or accumulated wealth. Furthermore, these loans have very small notional amount, because when a customer defaults, the financial intermediary would still have some chances of recovering losses (because the notional amount was relatively small). Lending large sums of money with interest rate over 20% to people with no income and wealth is an economically disastrous decision and will never work out \u2013 for this reason nobody does that. So, let\u2019s say there is a group of customers who possess a default risk that is reflected by 40% interest rate. It is still beneficial for the bank to lend, because while some people will default, others will pay back with 40% interest, and the profits generated will be enough to cover the cost of capital. Once you cap the rates to 20%, the return on the loans would not be sufficient so as to cover for the cost of capital when some people start defaulting. The proposition might claim that reducing the interest rates would decrease the risk of default. This would be just unsupported rhetoric \u2013 if lending at 20% would be also financially beneficial, it would have been made already due to fierce competition in the lending sector. We do not deny that there might be exceptional cases where the cap would only reduce the size of the loan (e.g. when the customer has quite a lot of assets), but taken at the face value, the cap would simply deny the loans to individuals."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "The cap would impose a burden on people with good credit", "argument": {"description": ["On the side of the opposition we believe that it is beneficial when banks are able to set the interest rates freely. Since the lending sector is characterized by intense competition, it ensures the most efficient pricing of assets. Those who have good credit can have loans at low interest rate, while those possessing bad credit have to pay extra for their risk. This encourages market discipline \u2013 as an individual you will be striving to improve your record over time to get better borrowing conditions. The pricing mechanism has been like this for quite some time and has been efficient \u2013 pricing of personal loans is relatively easy.", "Once you introduce the cap, there will be a burden on clients with good credit. It should be realized that the most likely real case when interest rates may be above 20% is that of short term borriwing when using credit cards. Very often, the agreement implies that the credit card interest rate changes whenever client\u2019s credit worthiness changes (could be decided upon various objective factors such as repayment of other loans, loss of employment, salary decrease). Such flexibility is indeed crucial because it allows to evaluate the default risk of a client whenever she decides to take a credit. Potentially there are customers whose credit worthiness may drop to such extent that they should be charged more than 20% interest rate. Once the cap is put (according to the government's plan), the banks won't be able to charge approapriate interest rate to ofset the high level of default risk. As a result, two scenarios are likely to occure. First, if agreement allows, a bank may simply deny lending to its customer (consequences of this scenario are analysed in the argument below). However, under second scenario, it is very likely that banks may not be able to throw their existing credit card users away and should provide them with a possibility to borrow. If the banks are not able to charge enough so as to reflect the risk, they will have to charge somebody else to compensate for potential losses. As a result, the averege interest rate charged from all customers will be increased. This will affect people with good credit, the ones who have been prudent and careful in spending.This is exactly the scenario that could be observed in insurance industry, whenever an insurance provider is not allowed to have full flexibility in setting different level pricing for customers having varying levels of risk. We do not see this as fair; in fact, we see this as especially unfair, because prudent behavior is punished and imprudent is rewarded."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "The cap would deprive individuals with bad credit of possibility to borrow", "argument": {"description": ["We find it very important that it is not the state, but the individuals who make decisions about their future, because they are the ones who know the most about their own situation and circumstances.

Consider a person who wants a loan for some purpose, but has a very bad credit history and very few valuable assets at her disposal. There are plenty of banks, but none would lend anything to him at lower than 30%. It is not because of the greediness of the bankers, it is because her profile is extremely risky and risk needs to be compensated with a higher return.

We find that it is completely up to these people to determine any price for the lending (which is interest rate) since any case have different risk, maturity, and number of other factors. In addition, high interest rates deter excessive borrowing; therefore, it would never boost any bubble or cause another sub-prime mortgage crisis, as was previously alleged by the proposition. High interest rates serve for contraction purposes and allow economies to get to their fundamental values. There is no third party harm here, whatsoever.", "Instead of limiting a choice by banning some options state may ensure that more information is provided for individuals. In the case of quick credits sometimes people are just not aware of the interest rate they will be paying.

Also, it is a good idea to require all loan companies to clearly show annualized interest rates in their advertisements to avoid any confusions.", "Finally, we contend that sometimes borrowing at a high rate for individuals may be a choice of the last resort. For example, a person needs a small credit for basic needs: food, rent and to be able to take care of her family. The pay for her job is due only in a week so short term loan despite the high interest rate is simply the best choice. If interest rates are capped, then that person would not get a loan, since her risk profile does not correspond to the interest the lender gets.

The whole purpose of financial intermediation is to allocate scarce resources spatially and over time. We create banks, because they are more efficient and they are capable of allocating these resources. We create them, because due to their size and diversification capabilities they are able to manage high risk, unlike single individuals. Prudent management of high risk projects/loans has a high societal value, and we appreciate that \u2013 it allows people to borrow, creating value for them. On the other hand, the government doesn\u2019t really posses the knowledge of how financial resources could be efficiently allocated. The cap will lead to suboptimal outcomes, by preventing financial institutions, who can bear higher risk, from doing so while at the same time restricting individuals from access to financial resources.", "-\tThe rebuttal to our second point is just a short version of our own argument with emphasis on other points.

If the central bank of a country pursues a very contractionary monetary policy to control inflation or for another reason (high real interest rates and high inflation are not mutually exclusive), the obvious result is that the base interest rate in the economy will be very high. One needs to understand that rates of commercial banks move in accordance with the base interest rate (ceteris paribus). The commercial banks can either put deposits into central bank and enjoy high interest, or give out commercial loans that would need to have higher interest rates (more risk as compared to the deposit within the central bank). As the base interest rate approaches 20%, the banks will be automatically prevented by giving out any loans to customers of any risk and they will put everything into deposits within the central bank.", "Even if we would accept the notion that banks should be controlled, a more reasonable approach would be to control the spread between central bank interest rate and personal lending.

Hence, the clients that have a risk profile which approximately corresponds to 20% interest rate will be sometimes eligible to take loans and sometimes not. So, if a person got a loan of 20% when base interest rates was 1%, she will not be able to get it anymore when it will be 6% (25% would be required for her riskiness).

Although some people consider life in the Soviet Union to be good, because of employment it provided to its citizens, harmful things done by the Soviet Union are enormous. The development of Baltic states was slowed down during that time, because there was no flow of ideas from abroad. Planned economy caused insufficient supply of goods and people weren't able to buy goods they wanted. Limits were put on the freedom of individuals, which also slowed the development process, because creative and innovative people were often put in jails. The intelligence from Baltic states mostly was either killed or sent to Siberia, which also harmed the development of these regions. The great part of soil was deprived because of agricultural technologies the Soviet Union used, which harmed the development of agriculture in Baltic states. Some people could argue that these sins are debatable and there is no consensus on whether the occupation of Baltic states by the Soviet Union was or wasn't harmful for these states. According to the Governments of Baltic states, the United States, the U.S. courts of law, the European Parliament, the European Court of Human Rights, and the United Nations Human Rights Council, three Baltic states were invaded, occupied and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union under provisions of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact first by the Soviet Union, then by Nazi Germany from 1941-1944, and again by the Soviet Union from 1944-1991 [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states]]. In short that means that the occupation was found to be illegal by the whole civilized society. Just like an image of a rape, if this is illegal and unacceptable in society, it is not allowed to display symbols that are associated with it in public. A hammer and a sickle is definitely associated with the Soviet Union and thus the occupation of Baltic states.", "If the opposition wants to argue that taboos should be broken and brought to public, we want to bring up a picture of a rape once again. No one thinks of breaking a taboo on rape by exposing public to images of a man raping a woman, because a rape is considered to be a violent crime. We believe that illegal occupation is also a crime, but in this case it is a crime against the whole three countries.", "The opposition brought the right for self-expression in their point. Here we would like to repeat once again that even if a person wears a t-shirt with a swastika without thinking about the crimes done by Nazi Germany, but about their employment policy, he harms other people in society, because swastika is regarded as a symbol of Nazi Germany and most of people in society think of war crimes and genocide when they hear about Nazi Germany, which is unpleasant for them.

As the societies are no longer afraid of the symbols themselves, the organizations do not cause fear, and thus do not gain additional power, as the government tries to imply. We believe that the reason why some organisations choose swastikas is because they are weak politically and this is the way how to attract attention (i.e. be exposed in media). They are not that much for the ideology itself, they just find it a good brand which they can use. Hence, it is just a means of promotion, and we find society in Baltic states apathetic to it.

Because such distinction is arbitrary, such precedent increases the risk that such ban may be use in other cases for other ideologies and symbols. In other words, dictating what the beliefs and identity people should have, the government becomes oppressive.

This is so, for two reasons.", "First, is that there is no universal absoliute truth. A belief, no matter how unrealistic or immoral it might be, remains truth in the minds of those who bedieve in it. Thus, it is not enough to ban only the symbol, because the underlying ideology of the carrier of the symbol is not going to change. Actually, the situation gets even worse because the society is less likely to spot the people who believe in certain ideologies that are dangerous to the society. Because the symbols enhance the understanding of the evil ideas they represent, they mobilize the society to fight against these ideologies.", "Second, people have to understand that certain ideologies are wrong for a reason not just because the government bans them. Thus, they are less likely to join certain ideologies as well as more eager to fight against them."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Summary of the opposition", "argument": {"description": ["The government in the debate had a burden to show that the benefits of the ban of Nazi and Soviet symbols outweigh the costs of such prohibition. Throughout the debate the opposition has been consistently pointing out the shortcomings in the reasoning of the government and showed how exactly such prohibition would not help.", "We would like to briefly remind you the main arguments and clashes.", "First, the government believes that a symbol is no different from other forms of communication. On the side of the opposition we agree that a symbol is a form of communication, but we most definitely disagree with the claim that it is no different. The first difference is that it is most definitely more abstract and can mean various things to various people. Perhaps a no-smoking sign, an example given by the government, unambiguously tells people not to smoke (but it is not necessarily so, for instance, such a sign could also be a logo of organization that is against smoking or something else depending on the context), but most of the symbols are extremely ambiguous and abstract and here we are talking about swastika that comes from ancient times and symbolizes sun, and hammer and sickle - symbols of the working people. The second difference in which a symbol is not like verbal or written communication is that it is a passive display of opinion. Whenever we talk, we put our emotions into it. When we are angry, we can yell at people which can put our words in a different context. Words \"I love you\" can be either loving or sarcastic, depending on the tone. If symbols could talk, they would all the time carry the same neutral voice and it would be for the ones who listen to decide on the actual meaning. Thus symbols are just passive form of affiliation. Because of the two mentioned differences, it is could be hardly claimed that a symbol is no different from other forms of communication and this is what the government failed to realize.", "The first harm of the symbols brought up by the government was extremist movement encouragement. The essence of the argument was that these symbols keep the extremist groups strong. Without them, extremists would become weaker. It might be the case that there are some groups that are actually united by these symbols. There might also be cases of groups that merely use symbols but are not ideologically attached to them. The point here is, banning the symbols would at best not change anything and in the worst case scenario worsen the current situation. The groups with weak ideological attachment to symbols arguably would change their symbols to new ones and continue their aggressive acts. As the symbols were not important, it would not be a big deal to change them. The groups in which ideology plays very strong role, the prohibition of symbols will call a negative reaction and strong discontent. The groups will feel unjustly suppressed and feel a need to rebel against society that ignores them. The ban will reinforce symbols and strengthen them because of the taboo which is always created when something is banned. Also, we would like to point out that the symbols have already lost most of their power and have been commercialized to some extent. The Soviet symbols are used on T-shirts and souvenirs, people generally do not view them as offensive. Such symbols are not attractive for extremists but banning them can reverse that. So far we can see that there are absolutely no benefits to banning these symbols. But in fact, it is possible to have some benefits - if the symbols are banned and by some miracle they are not used by extremist organizations anymore. However, thinking that the extremists would give up their ideological symbols so easily is a very bold assumption which is very unlikely to be true. Hence, we rule it out and say that we are quite certain that the prohibition of symbols cannot make extremist organizations weaker.", "Secondly, the government seems to believe that Nazi and Soviet symbols are just another form of hate speech. It has been noted above that symbols are too abstract and too passive to be put in one line with a phrase like \u201cWe should commit genocide of one or another nation\u201d. Hate speech is called as it is, because when you hear it, you can feel certain emotions \u2013 in this case \u2013 hatred towards other people. Symbols themselves cannot carry emotions. Furthermore, there is no proof that the need to feel hatred towards other people would change just because of the prohibition of a certain symbol. To put shortly, symbols cannot be classified as hate speech and banning them would not change the need to hate other people.", "The final argument presented by the government was that exposing certain things is still banned even if it doesn't promote committing any harmful actions. However, the opposition would like to note that there are always some criteria according to which decisions to ban or not to ban are made. The usual criterion is the third party harm. Claiming that we ban some things just for the sake of banning (because these things are somehow \u201cimmoral\u201d) is simply wrong. We do not allow exposing rape not because it is immoral, but because the act itself is wrong and public display of it is humiliating to the victim. But we do allow the face of the rapist to be shown. Banning a symbol is comparable to banning the face of a rapist (or if the scale is too small \u2013 like banning the face of Stalin). The government tells us that it is in the interest of society to ban these symbols, because generally seeing them is unpleasant. However, their plan leaves the public exhibition of the very same symbols in museums and use for educational purposes. Why should we allow the educative use of Nazi / Soviet symbols? They will recall the same unpleasantness there as anywhere else. After all, we do not show pictures of rapes for education, do we?", "The government made a case that it is legitimate to limit the freedom of speech when society is left better of as a result of that limitation. However, they failed to prove that such a ban would have some tangible benefits to the society; therefore, we see no reasons why such a ban should be implemented.", "On the contrary, the opposition has outlined some strong arguments against the prohibition of display of Nazi / Soviet symbols.", "Individuals have a right to self expression. It is most certainly true that it is not absolute (as was noted by the government), but we believe that there is no tangible third party harm involved in displaying Nazi / Soviet symbols due to the abstract nature of symbols that has been proved by the opposition. And because of this, a right to self expression is a principle we should adhere to. It should be realized that such right is valuable per se, because it allows the individuals to freely express themselves, which is good, because we live in a free and open society and we generally value liberty and we want to let people to do whatever they wish as long as they do not interfere with other people\u2019s liberties.", "We should also allow public display of these symbols, because we want public discourse to happen. When a symbol is free to use, he can remind the ideas behind him. These ideas are the basis for further discussion, so society can freely discuss whatever lies behind them and choose what is acceptable for them and what is not. The people themselves are capable of deciding whether it is worth to take something from these ideas or not. By depriving people of such a choice, a government gets a monopoly of truth where it decides what is right and what is wrong. This is fundamentally wrong, because there are no absolute truths in the world. The society is left worse off, because some ideas, although they might be appealing for the society, just by government\u2019s arbitrary decision were deemed to be fundamentally wrong and not suitable for further discussion. Publicity and open discussion is how false ideologies are fought against in a free society. Prohibitions and government interference is a sign of a totalitarian government\u2019s regime.", "Finally, the opposition wants to remind you of the practical harms that would be caused by this ban. The ban would just fuel the already tense relationships between Russians and natives in the Baltic States, also the relationship between the countries. The government thinks that this move will actually encourage the Baltic-Russian debate; unfortunately we fail to see how exactly banning these symbols is debate. On the contrary, rigid stance of the Baltic States on this issue can deter Russia from having any further discussions with three Baltic countries.", "Since in the debate the government has not proved that there are tangible benefits to banning the Nazi / Soviet symbols, and the harms of such prohibition were explicitly shown by the opposition, we humbly beg you to oppose."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}]}, {"url": "https://debatewise.org/debates/1192-we-should-prize-freedom-over-security-and-abolish-anti-terrorism-legislation/", "claim_title": "We should prize freedom over security and abolish anti-terrorism legislation", "topic": [], "perspectives_for_count": 6, "perspectives_for": [{"perspective_title": "Anti-terrorism legislation undermines democracies", "argument": {"description": ["Throughout the history we have seen examples when states abused their power and committed crimes against the people of their own.

It does not take a genius to figure out that with this proportion of arrested to convicted people (more than 100-1); most of the people arrested had no relation to terrorism whatsoever. But the arbitrary nature of the Act allowed numerous violations of human rights; something you would normally expect when for questioning the sovereignty of India you can be imprisoned for life[[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/Tada.htm#4]].", "Now obviously these are evil and corrupt countries and this would not happen in countries with strong democratic traditions?

Anti-terrorist legislation, when it gives huge discretionary powers to enforcing agencies and when appropriate safeguards are not set, effectively incentivizes them to violate the human rights. This was illustrated in our previous point. The issue should be reconsidered from another angle when the targets of intelligence agencies are people who can be easily attributed to a certain group (a minority or a religious group). For instance, in the US, obviously, Muslim community is subject to more investigation by secret services because Al-Qaeda is of Muslim origin.", "What does this imply? Intelligence agencies, given broad powers by anti-terrorist legislation (unlimited detention, etc.), will effectively discriminate against a certain group of people. This has two undesirable implications.", "First, it is incompatible with every treaty of human rights that is usually recognized in our society. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights postulates that \u201cAll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law\u201d. We do not think that in this debate we have to prove this truism. We think that any reasonable person would agree with the notion. Taking into account the wide discretionary powers anti-terrorism legislation gives for the state, it will eventually result in suppression and discrimination of minorities when they are considered a cause of terrorism. We see the fundamental principle of equality breached here.", "Second, it will have broader negative implications. The discrimination will send a message to these communities, and not a very positive one. The image that will be instilled in the minds of these people will be something among these lines: \u201cThey are the ones who discriminate us for no reasons; they are the ones who treat us inhumanely\u201d. Once we separate the society into US and THEM, we cannot expect them to act so kindly towards us. Obviously we can expect some kind of retaliation from the people we treated poorly. So for instance, when Muslims are being tortured in Guantanamo, it sends quite a message to all Muslim community, and not a friendly one. It just gives another reason to hate the Western world. Empirical evidence supporting our case is extensive. Scholars find that the penitentiary system tends to punish most vulnerable social groups[[MONCL\u00daS MAS\u00d3, Marta (2005) La gesti\u00f3n penal de la inmigraci\u00f3n.

The effects of exceptional legislation on criminalization of immigrants and people suspected of terrorism.]].

It is effectively the government who labels certain crimes as threat to national security and allows applying anti-terrorism measures. Such crimes as hostage taking, bombing, and hijacking are very serious, but were previously subject to criminal justice. Since the anti-terrorism laws are vague, any of these crimes can be treated as terrorism. Not only these crimes (that are rather serious), but virtually any crimes. For instance, THE PATRIOT Act treats something as terrorism when it *appears to intend to* : (i) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping[[USA PATRIOT Act, 2001]]. Such things as intimidating a civilian population can mean virtually anything. In the very end it means that crimes that should be subject to criminal law will be treated as terrorism, which is something we strongly oppose (and the virtues of criminal justice system are outlined in our next point). In essence, anti-terrorism legislation violates the principle of legal certainty which states that legislation needs to be clear and precise, because otherwise it will be subject to a lot of interpretation and arbitrariness.", "Unfortunately, there are many examples where governments do tailor the definition of terrorism to suit their agendas.

The society can be reliant on the system of criminal justice because it has several important characteristics, namely checks and balances that ensure that the courts of law reach the best decision. These checks and balances include independent and impartial courts which ensure that the rule of law is respected. The criminal justice system ensures access to legal defense. It ensures that you have access to evidence and witnesses. It makes certain types of evidence inadmissible in courts of law (for instance, the one obtained from torture). Most fundamentally, it embraces the principle that you are innocent unless proven guilty. Anti-terrorism legislation violates these principles. Civilians are often tried in military courts; the burden of proof is reversed (detainees have to prove that they are not guilty), they are denied access to witnesses and evidence, have poor legal defense, if any. Once we allow this, abuse takes place as innocent people can be convicted of anything rather easily.", "For instance, your neighbor works in the secret service. He is not a nice guy and does not like you, because once you slept with his wife. Being a smart and ingenious guy, he intercepts your conversations. Since in one of the conversations you explicitly denounce the government of your own country and say that it is no wonder that terrorists attack it, it is enough for him to tell to his friends in the secret service that you are a dangerous guy. Afterwards, you are detained in prison with no charges against you for two months.", "Although our example is completely fictional, it can happen easily. We see absurd situations around us \u2013 we\u2019ve given quite a lot of examples of them already, for instance, our story of 16-year-old boy fetched from home and detained for months fits well enough to illustrate the point.", "It is most certainly not true that ordinary criminal justice system does not have the preventive capacity and would not help to prevent terrorist attacks. On the contrary, the system of criminal justice has a long record of successful investigations and prevention of terrorism. A comprehensive study finds out that in the US since late 1980's there were 135 terrorist prosecutions. It confirms that \"that the federal courts have a proven track record of serving as an effective and credible system for prosecuting and incapacitating terrorists\"[[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/prosecute/]]. Scholars conclude that the greatest danger of terrorism is overreaction of democracies [[Kent Roach, The Criminal Law and Terrorism]]. In a detailed study of human rights and terrorism, it is found that anti-terrorism legislation pose a serious threat to human rights and democracies, as confirmed by witnesses from various countries: \"(In Argentina) Legislation risked replicating the serious human rights violations of the past and that the existing criminal law was sufficient to address new terrorist threats. In Kenya too, the Panel was told that counter-terrorist laws, supported by western governments, may reverse important safeguards. In Northern Ireland, concerns were expressed that new UK-wide anti-terrorism legislation might hurt the process of political normalization underway\"[[Assessing Damage, Urging Action. Report of the Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter-terrorism and Human Rights. p. 28]]. The same panel of jurists conclude that countries should rely on their criminal justice systems for countering terrorism.", "The virtue of the criminal justice system is that it does not rely on completely discretionary power of enforcement agencies. It is subject to the checks and balances which are so fundamental in ensuring justice. It is false that if we abolish anti-terrorism legislation, suddenly we will no longer be able to have any preventive measures. Now intelligence agencies are able to intercept any conversation at their own discretion, whenever they want to. If we abolish the legislation, they will have to get approval of a judge for their interceptions. The judge in this case acts as an independent party which ensures that investigators do not abuse their powers. Hence, the criminal justice system is capable of a) countering terrorism, b) ensuring justice. It can be claimed falsely that criminal justice system is \u201cnot flexible enough for these circumstances\u201d. We strongly reject accusations like this. It is not flexible enough, because it is *not supposed* to be flexible in the first place. It is not supposed to allow unlimited detention without any charges. It is not supposed to place the burden of proof on the detainee. It is not supposed to allow military courts in civil cases. It is supposed to have appropriate checks and balances which ensure that enforcement agencies do not abuse their power (which they apparently do with anti-terrorism legislation as is proven in many of our examples). They have checks and balances, because we as a society are opposed to concentration of power, we want a balance which ensures that our freedoms and justice are preserved.", "If security would be our ultimate goal, we would convict every person when there is is even low probability that he actually was guilty and we would apply the strongest measures. Also, we would do this not only with terrorists, but also with ordinary crime. But this is not how we want our society to function. We also want people who are convicted of terrorism but are innocent to be able to prove their innocence. The standards applicable to ordinary crime and terrorism should be in line. Ordinary crime causes more deaths than terrorism and is more frequent. There is no fundamental difference why terrorism should be treated separately from other crime, especially taking into account the vagueness of what terrorism is (as was developed in our previous point). It is easier for the governments to psychologically position and justify terrorism as it is something which creates fear, but by no means it justifies extraordinary measures taken to prevent it, especially assuming it takes away from us so many of our liberties, abuses us and convicts innocent people."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Anti-terrorism legislation is not how we should fight terrorism", "argument": {"description": ["In dealing with most of the problems in our societies there are several ways how to actually tackle them.

Sedatives like Valium now highly used by many people got the third place in this \u201cpeople killing\u201d competition. The number of deaths that involved prescription opioid analgesics increased from 2,900 in 1999 to 7,500 in 2004, which in other words in an increase of 160% in just 5 years. However, during the same time rates of overdose deaths from heroin or cocaine remained flat. The reason for these deaths in the first place is the increasing usage of these legal drugs.  The country wide research in the US showed the positive correlation between unintentional death from overdose rates and usage of painkillers and sedatives. On the second place is abuse and misuse of these legal drugs.   [[http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2008/03/t20080312b.html]]", "We live in society where people are constantly overwhelmed with stress and problems. Some people do sports to cope with it, some people like fishing and resting in nature, but some people use sedatives to cope with high pressure or painkillers to cancel their headache. These prescription drugs are legal since they are regarded to be more or less harmful. The evidence we gave show how even these relatively harmless drugs could cause deaths of thousands of people. Illegal drugs are now banned. One of the reasons is that they are more harmful than prescription drugs. The other one is that addiction and tolerance towards them develops very fast. Imagine now the situation after amphetamine, cocaine and heroin are legalized. They all are even better painkillers than prescription drugs and they also all are more addictive. Now people if they want to get a sedative or a painkiller have to see a doctor, explain him their problems, and only then, if the doctor considers it to be worth, they could get a recipe. If the doctor refuses in prescribing a drug, they have to think out a sophisticated way of abusing the system, which could be hard to imagine and implement. Imagine now better and more violent painkillers are legalized. People don\u2019t have to see a doctor anymore to get their recipe. They just go to a supermarket and buy a dose of heroin. It is amazing how it helps to get rid of their headache they think. The next time they have brutal headache they visit the store once again. And after one more they are hooked and have to use heroin just because otherwise their body can\u2019t function. Moreover, tolerance is developed soon. Now they have to buy not a one dose of heroin to feel the effect, but two, three or five times more. In the end police finds them drown in their vomit and report one more heroin overdose death.", "Statistics proves that people are very eager on dying from prescription drug overdose even now, although acquiring drugs involves significant costs of going to doctor or abusing a system. If we legalize better painkillers and sedatives, but more violent ones, which are more likely to cause death, we believe that rates of such death cases will skyrocket. Predicting that the proposition could call legal status of prescription drugs and illegal of heroin or cocaine to be unfair, we would like to say that we feel the debate to be more about what is good and what is not, rather than what is fair in relation to evil substances. We would like very much to cancel all death of such kind, but these drugs are necessary for some people. That\u2019s why we strive for stricter regulations and control. If we could alter these deaths at least partially by banning drugs, we go for it.", "By the way statistics we have given ruins the argument of forbidden fruit once again. The huge number of deaths from drugs accounts mostly for legal prescription drugs. The increase in these rates accounts for prescription drugs as well with rates of deaths caused by heroin and cocaine remaining flat. The amount of deaths caused by legal drugs is also higher than the amount of deaths during the epidemics of heroin in the 1970s or the outbreak of cocaine-crack in the 1990s. This proves that people chose what is easier to acquire rather than what is forbidden when making a decision. They prefer to go to a doctor and buying a prescription drug, rather than visiting a drug dealer to try out a \u201cforbidden fruit\u201d. This is because going to a doctor is legal and doesn\u2019t involve any consequences if they are caught by police. Also going to a doctor is easier because they could find the address of a hospital in the record book and don\u2019t have to search for it. However, finding a drug dealer involves searching for it and meeting him or visiting certain unpleasant places in unpleasant districts. Thus most of people prefer convenience rather than feelings from trying something forbidden. If you make serious drugs available and easy to buy, people won\u2019t stop consuming them because they are not forbidden any more. A more likely scenario is that they switch to them from prescription drugs and consume more of them, since costs involved in acquiring them (including time and the fact they are breaking the law) fall significantly.", "In the very end we would like to note one more mechanism of how legalization leads to an increased consumption. By putting a status \u201cillegal\u201d on something we show that it is potentially harmful and using it could cause serious consequences. Imagine if the state now legalizes drugs, it sends a clear message to public that drugs \u201care not that bad\u201d. In fact, it puts it even lower than prescription drugs in the list of potential harmfulness, since no regulations were proposed. This shows people that heroin is less harmful than Valium and they start substituting Valium for heroin, since it also helps to calm down."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}]}, {"url": "https://debatewise.org/debates/1053-poorer-countries-should-abandon-free-trade-agreements/", "claim_title": "Poorer Countries Should Abandon Free Trade Agreements", "topic": [], "perspectives_for_count": 8, "perspectives_for": [{"perspective_title": "Free Trade is not Fair Trade", "argument": {"description": ["Free trade creates an equal business environment.

Using alcohol for a long time creates both a psychological and physiological addiction, and it is very complicated to supress the desire to drink.", "We believe that there is a significant risk that these patients will continue drinking after the procedure. Even though there is a six-month sobriety period before any liver transplantation, empirical evidence shows that heavy drinkers go back to their old ways and start drinking again [[http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/1/55]]. Why is this likely to fail the procedure?", "Firstly, all receivers of a liver always face a high chance of getting an infection, so they have to take immunosuppressant drugs that strengthen their immune system. Using alcohol is extremely detrimental for the immune system. It also negatively effects the impact of the immunosuppressant drugs.

One of the definitions one could give to fairness is that all people should be given an equal right. However, in some cases there is no possibility to do so. Imagine a situation when we have one liver and two patients applying for a transplant. One of them is 50 years old and has been a heavy drinker for 20 years, which caused his liver disease, the other one is a young healthy man who has been doing sports all his lifetime and is concerned about his health condition, but got the liver disease because of bad genes.

We cannot cut it in halves, thus the best \u201cfair\u201d decision we could make is to provide them with equal chances of getting the liver, i.e. to flip a coin. Although this is just, it is arguable whether the best outcome has been achieved.", "First we see that a young healthy man has more chances to survive after the operation, which is brought in details in our first argument. Secondly, we believe that it was mostly the fault of alcoholic himself in getting the liver disease, thus it could have been prevented if he had been more concerned about his health.

In the case, a patient\u2019s fault is negligible. For most it is his decision not to wear a scarf, otherwise it is mostly bad luck. In the second case it is mostly a decision of an individual to drink heavily and thus getting the liver disease. We believe that since the resources for treatment are scarce, it is fair to treat in the first place those who got the disease because of bad luck or bad genes, denying them who were responsible themselves in getting the disease.", "People know that if they drink they get the liver disease, thus they are aware of these consequences when they make the decision to drink. In this case the disease is preventable, while in the case with bad genes it is unpreventable. If a person likes fast driving he is taking the responsibility for the possible consequences of his actions. Insurance companies deny fixing a car after a driving accident caused by the driver. Government in some cases could deny in providing the treatment for free after an accident which was caused by speeding. This is done because these people break the duty of care, break their responsibilities and take actions being aware of all the harmful consequences.", "Moreover, if the government gives liver transplants to alcoholics it takes away it from other people. The government could try to distribute welfare in such a way that all citizens achieve the same satisfaction, thus all in need of treatment get the treatment. But it will sufficiently harm other people, since the government will end up in wasting scarce resources on people who don\u2019t maximize their utility from these resources, people who waste their liver on heavy drinking.", "But there is also another approach. The government tries to equalize endowments given to people at the initial stage, and then it is up to individual\u2019s decision how to maximize utility from that. In such a case an alcoholic initially has a healthy liver and could prevent his disease, but a person with bad genes initially has an unhealthy liver and his disease is unpreventable, thus their endowments are not equal. It is the duty of government to equalize their states by giving a liver transplant to the person with bad genes, thus giving him a priority over the alcoholic.", "One could say that being first in the waiting list is the fair criteria. However, we argue about whether to put heavy drinkers on this list at all. By putting them on the list, resources are taken away from other patients, thus the distribution occurs at the moment when it is decided whether to put a patient on the list. In the United States there are about 17,000 people waiting on the list, and the median time for waiting in 2006 was 321 days.[[http://www.livermd.org/waiting.html]] This illustrates the scarcity of the resource and makes the question of who should be given the liver inevitable.", "(2)\tHow the choice of becoming an alcoholic is made?", "Some might argue that if we judge upon merit, we consider that all alcoholics have made the decision to become one only by themselves, thus no external factor was involved. Now we will try to get to the nature of alcoholism and identify any mechanisms how people become alcoholics.", "First people are most likely to drink for fun. It is a clear situation of free choice and no external factors are involved. Then there are people who drink to support community around them: friends, relatives, colleagues etc. While in this case there is an external factor involved to some degree, we believe it is still not worth arguing that the decision is mostly a matter of the individual.", "The next group of reasons for drinking we see is external community (bad neighborhood, alcoholic families etc.) and moral trauma or depression. In the first case while the external factors could put a significant pressure on the individual, so he starts drinking, it is still his free choice. To make an analogy: there is no such justification for committing a crime as pressure from external community. Also bad neighborhood of a convicted person is not a justification and by no means could reduce the punishment, since committing the crime was still a free choice decision. We believe that the same mechanism is applicable here. In the second case, people could seek for a fast solution in alcohol after they were exposed to a serious moral trauma. The proportion of individual\u2019s decision is still pretty high, because, first of all, drinking is not the only solution and there are other means of dealing with depression; secondly, after the time has passed and the trauma has become less harmful, a person could abandon drinking.", "We consider a significant influence of addiction to alcohol. To deal with it there are certain programs, such as Anonymous Alcoholics, which have proven to be pretty successful ones. So, even if a person has become addicted to alcohol, he could still cure from this addiction and prevent the liver disease from happening.", "To sum up, we believe that when resources are scarce, it is acceptable to distribute them fairly upon merit, which allows punishing alcoholics for not taking care of their liver and giving priority to those who have the disease because of external factors. We see the decision to drink as a free decision made by an individual after a certain cost-benefit analysis, thus he is the one to take responsibility of all the consequences.

We have shown how consumption of alcohol can often lead to lethal consequences after the operation.", "Why is that bad?

This is a basic requirement for the sake of successful surgery. On the other hand, what the Proposition has been proposing today is that the doctors will deny the transplants to all of those who have a record of alcohol abuse and thereby \u201cbrought the disease upon themselves\u201d (as they would like to believe.) With that clear distinction in mind, we on the opposition sees that the Propositions point on how their policy is a just another part of criteria already taking in place is invalid.", "Also we would like to point out that in the status quo, liver transplants are not given to the alcoholic patients who have been drinking to excess in the past 6 months, because the doctors sees that it is a proven fact that liver transplants will not work on those patients who simply cannot refrain from drinking even when they are about to get a transplant. This is a given fact for sure. However, as we have mentioned again and again, the Proposition is assuming that \u201cgiving this man a new liver when he\u2019s an alcohol addict \u2018will probably\u2019 [lead to] relapse.\u201d And from their statistics we see that 38% of the alcoholic patients may drink after the surgery while the other 62% does not.

We see that they would even like to use it as a societal institution that can do the moral calculus for the doctors. However, the reality is that making the final decision on whether or not the patient will be able to survive and how much the \u201cblame\u201d is to be placed on is fundamentally made by the doctors. It is a burden that they cannot simply be dismissed from. In light of that, we have to reminded of the fact that in this situation, doctors can never have the full assurance that an alcoholic patient who has not drank for the past 6 months will not be able to survive the surgery. Only the facts proving the contrary continue to surface. Thus under the ethical guidelines that binds all doctors, they are required to carry out the treatments in the best interest of the patients.", "In the end, it all comes down to the question of whether or not there is a chance these patients can survive.

Now, since the very beginning of the process it is evident the criteria applied into it is highly susceptible to change, we all know that the value of economical goods changes with time, but of course this is not limited to that, each day experiences contribute to the constant formation of human thinking patterns, and thus their perspectives.

Given that the wealthy partner will lose 50% of his assets on divorce he has a much greater financial duress to remain in the relationship and put up with infidelity, neglect etc. This means that the poor person has an opportunity to abuse the rich person in marriage, an abuse, that the rich person could fight against with a pre-nup agreement.", "2. Many states incorporate systems of alimony whereby in situations where a partner provides continuing financial support to another partner, that support must be continued for a term in the marriage [[http://www.rbs2.com/dfault.pdf]] . This term was put in place to protect housewives who have no financial income of their own, but changing conditions have made this term open to exploitation by other parties. For example, under Massachusetts law if a wife provided financial support to her husband to support him in an attempt to launch him into a career in a small business or in the arts, she would still be obliged to continue to provide that financial support beyond the termination of marriage under the term of alimony. Clearly, this provides disproportionate power to the husband, who will be receiving unjustified financial support from the wife after the end of marriage.", "These two examples show that state based divorce systems also contain the capacity for abuse.

Pre-nuptial agreements provide specificity. There can only be ONE State system for splitting assets.  That system is a blanket ruling, it is limited in the scope and the type of conditions that it can impose on couples. If the conditions are too specific then the State runs the risk of dis-empowering certain forms of marriage. For example some people may want to include terms against infidelity in their pre-nup, but if the State was to force that condition on everybody then it would dis-empower forms of open marriage, where both partners have a more open view of sexuality. The point is that in prenuptial agreements these sort of subjective matters, where nobody can objectively decide on what is right, are left in individual hands. Then everybody can decide what is right for them. And there are so many things in life and love for which there are no objective criteria to judge on their rightness or wrongness!", "3.

Through this they try to justify the motion of not considering pre-nuptial agreements in courts.", "We have four points in rebuttal to that idea:", "1. The point that couples who are entering into pre-nups do not consider the possibility of divorce, may hold if everyone were entering pre-nups, but that isn't the case. Most people stay with the State based system. Pre-nups are only entered into by couples who make an active decision to leave the State based system, who decide that the State system isn't right for them, and we would argue that this represents a significant selection effect. A couple who has already decided that one divorce system is not right for them is clearly not a couple that is incapable of considering divorce.", "2. Love may mean that the decision isn't a perfectly considered, objectively rational view, but so what-- people fall in love and get married based on impulse to a large extent anyway. There are lots of decisions that have confounding factors. People tend not to think they'll get sick, we still let them decide whether to get health insurance or not. Optimism doesn't mean you take away an individuals decision making freedom because they might make imperfect choices, and to do so is patronizing for any State. People should be allowed to make imperfect decisions in a free society.", "3. Even if impulse is present, decisions are made with constant advisement from legal professionals who actively question their decisions, these aren't things the individuals write up themselves on sheets of paper.", "4. Finally, most of what goes into a pre-nup has nothing to do with divorce per se. Most of a pre-nup determines the responsibilities within a marriage, what each partner needs to do to remain without fault should a marriage be terminated. This section only requires the couple to have a considered view of what they think a marriage should be. Given that they are getting married, we think that this is something they should have. Even the sections that deal with divorce don't require an individual to think that they will be divorced. It simply requires an individual to decide what they believe would be fair under this hypothetical scenario. People have shown themselves capable of declaring decisions under hypothetical scenarios, no matter how unlikely they believe these scenarios to be, so we don't think the effect of love, which only impacts the person's assessment of the probability of divorce, would impair their ability to decide what they think would be fair under that hypothetical scenario.", "Furthermore, we think that all sorts of dangerous and absurd conclusions can be drawn if we consider people to be irrational when they're getting married. If people are irrational about the terms in the pre-nup, then surely it must follow that they irrational about what they want from their marriage and how the decisions they make during marriage. Should the State then have the right to decide how people should behave within marriages? Love is often an irrational impulse, that means that they are irrational about whom they chose as their partner. Does that then mean that the State should decide what sort of partner people should be with? That is clearly an absurd scenario and the fact that it is absurd to most people shows how much people value individual liberty and decision making, even if that entails risk.", "The second argument that we want to consider in more depth here is the argument of ''future blindness''. The proposition claims that the fact that decisions made in the past may become detrimental to individuals in the future, because of changing circumstances should be a basis for not considering those past decisions in court. If they really believe this then they wouldn't approve of marriage. When you marry someone you sign a contract that you may later regret. Future blindness is a necessary evil for every marriage. Society accepts that there exists a pretty good correlation between who you are now and who you are in the future and the sense of individual continuity. Otherwise there would be no basis for punishing crimes.", "They raise the problem of mutual consent, the fact that you cannot change your decision without agreeing with the other party first. But we think that responsibility is a good thing. People are held accountable for their past decisions in society, there's nothing wrong with that. Also, just because one individual in the marriage changes their views, shouldn't mean that the other party shouldn't be protected. The liberty of one person to exit a pre-nup shouldn't come at the cost of another person.", "Either way the problem of mutual consent falls when we look at the alternative-- the State imposing the terms of divorce on you. In that scenario you have no consent at all, you are entrapped into what the State thinks is right for you. In the point ''The State imposed system is not objectively right for everybody'', we show that the proposition has not proved to us that the State is objectively right. We think they'll have a difficulty proving it, because it is natural that all people are different, desire different things and that one-system-for-all, especially in such personal matters as marriage, simply will leave many people unhappy.", "Individuals have the right to enter into long-term contracts which have risks in the pursuit of good. Future risk acceptance is the fundamental freedom of human activity. We think that by proposition's argument people shouldn't be able to invest (because they might not receive returns on their investments) and shouldn't be able to vote (because your opinions might change before your elected politician enters into office and you no longer support them, or because he himself might change in that time period). A plethora of equally absurd examples can be brought if you follow the proposition's logic.", "In conclusion this argument was written to defend the validity of pre-nuptial agreements and the right of people to make such agreements. To do this we have given arguments against proposition's claim that pre-nups are irrational (but also pointed out that this idea can be reduced ad absurdum-- if pre-nups are irrational then chosing your partner in marriage is also irrational. Does that mean that the ''analytic and objective'' state should determine whom you marry?) and against their claim that future blindness is a fundamental harm in the case of pre-nups."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Banning pre-nuptial agreements actively harms some marriages.", "argument": {"description": ["The alternative to pre-nuptial agreements is State imposition.

The young woman hates the idea of being ostracized by her family, by her friends and by the community. If pre-nups are actionable she can offer a pre-nup in order to provide proof to the people around that her interest in the marriage are pure. If pre-nups are not recognized by divorce courts, she faces a painful dilemma of either marrying the man she loves and being ostracized by the community or not marrying him at all. This is just one example of how pre-nups are necessary to make a marriage work and for two people to be happy. We think that in general this is what proper pre-nuptials do : they make people happy. Not recognizing them is thus an active harm to some people's marriages.

If they are allowed to counter the risk of for example gold digging through pre-nuptial agreements, then the purity of marriage for is restored. This means that people can have happy unions, which in the case of State based terms they either wouldn't have entered or would have entered and ended up unhappy.

We showed that the analogies presented by proposition were in fact entirely and absolutely disanalagous, and that in a vast number of cases the state has not acted as a pathfinder at all.

The proposition has brought out that sometimes innocent individuals will be captured. Against this we argue that during the course of the trial the innocence or guilt of the captured individuals has to emerge. When it is established that the individual was indeed innocent the damage done to that person can be reversed by returning him to his home state. If however the individual is guilty, his capture would have potentially lead to the saving of lives of many civilians and thus is a proportional act.", "For proportional response to ever be applied, it is required that a country should have access to the entire spectrum of possible responses. Otherwise, it is impossible to select the response which matches the cause with the required severity. When options are taken from the table, what happens? Inevitably, a country will be left between two options, one which is less severe than that required, and one which is more severe. Even if we assume the country has mercy in its soul, and opts for the less response, the lack of proportionality will mean that it will not have fully served its purpose in cutting off the threat which provoked it, thereby making it less effective than the response that direct proportionality requires. Unfortunately, even this best case scenario is unlikely to happen. Countries are less sensitive to foreign deaths than those of their own citizens. Therefore, the path most chosen is likely to be that of greater than proportional vengeance, and therefore greater than proportional bloodshed.", "The importance of allowing small scale solutions to small scale problems is one widely recognised, at least implicitly, by modern nation states. Most nation states operate intelligence agencies, and many of these conduct operations overseas, often without the knowledge of local governments. And yet, the operations of these agents, who are the agents of a foreign state, and often involve the collection of sensitive information, or materials, is not, and is unlikely to ever be, considered a warcrime. The reason, is because without these small scale, surgical instruments at hand, states would have only far heavier tools for dismantling threats to their existence.", "In the case of extroardinary rendition.

Firstly, prior to a vaccine for polio, between 13,000 and 20,000 cases were reported in the USA annually.  In 1988, the World Health Organisation decided to try and eradicate polio worldwide, and as of today the disease has been removed from the USA, Western Pacific and Europe.

Another common disease \u2013 measles, affected nearly everyone in the United States prior to the vaccination being introduced. Between 1953 and 1963, there were 450 deaths each year from the disease. Currently in the US, three of every 1000 people who contract measles will die, whilst in the developing world, one in 100 will die. It is estimated that 90% of people who are exposed to the virus will get infected if not vaccinated against it. In 1999 according to the WHO, there were 900,000 measles related deaths worldwide.

The rush for the AIDS cure is based in it's potential profitability, but we know that due to lack of R&D (further promoted by the plan) poor countries (The most affected by AIDS) will not receive any profit, and will be left without the cure, since the patent won't belong to them.This could  be a public health issue for rich countries.

However, empirical evidence like earthquake-prone Japan, the Western countries that have bitter winters, Oil-deprived Israel and UAE, etc. vs tropical and resource abundant Africa and Latin America suggests the opposite correlation (adverse climate and scarcity of resources paired with economic success), we however don't think climate is a relevant factor to consider in this debate.", "They say that it is \"feasible but marginal\" that countries will deviate resources into other things rather than medical training because of the lack of transparency. They also claim that we agree that their plan is a source of revenue. First, revenue doesn't necessarily means profitability and less when they always express the transaction in terms of the cost as opposed to in terms of the value, it's not profitable to liquidate and asset for its cost because no profit is being made. Second, even if it was marginal, we are alarmed that the proposition thinks it's OK to give money to a corrupt government; but it is actually not marginal, but rather the norm. They asked us to make a mature reflection on  abandoning poor countries on the basis that they have corrupt government, but if they care so much about the people and the rights of the individual, how will they ensure the poorer government will invest that money to satisfy its citizens' needs? History shows that the ruling elite is the one that perceives the benefits of the income, so it is definitely better to have the medical personnel that is already there than its corruption-vulnerable monetary equivalent. Besides, since a correlation can be preceived between transparency and GDP per capita[[http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/corruption-vs-gdp-per-capita]], transferring resources from richer to poorer nations roughly amounts to transferring resources from less corrupt to more corrupt countries, thus the plan increases the amount of money falling prey to corruption and hence makes the world economy less efficient.", "They blame us of been trapped in a dilemma \"that is simultaneously opposed to the brain drain and in favor of the status quo\". Yes, we don't think the DB is good but no, we aren't really in favor of the SQ, it's just that we prefer it to the proposition plan, because it will worsen an already bad situation and wont solve the problem. Precisely because we know how individual rights are blasted in Third World countries, our main value, above all, is freedom. Yes to stopping brain drain but NOT at the cost of freedom. The real dilemma is on proposition's side, when they say that \"brain drain is unacceptable\" but they're willing to pay for it. As if money made things right, people who think drugs or prostitution are unacceptable aren't the ones advocating to create a legal market for it. They say that BD is an \"anomalous feature from the status quo a loophole that must be closed\"... that's a weird thing to say for a team that supports actively recruiting talent away from poorer countries. On the same point, their rebuttal to no point 3, they carelessly  intended to quote us as saying, \"now the offer of compensation could drive a country to wake up to the reality of brain drain and start taking measures to prevent it\", but they forgot (or did they?) to add:\u00a8\"which could reduce their freedom. Which in turn would do nothing to solve the real causes of the brain drain\". It is not about taking random measures and reducing freedom, but rather tackling the root causes that lead people to leave their country. It is very dangerous and sadly ironic to provide a way for repressive inefficient  governments to remain in power using the resources obtained from cashing in on their political expatriates", "We showed a link between brain drain and ever growing populism, instability and fundamentalism. Prop. wanted to get this \"dismissed easily, as history is riddled with cases where populations have doubted their governments, but we have not been such mass migration as the opposition suggested\". Sure, except for the Cuban exodus to the US, USSR migration to the West, African legal and illegal immigration to Europe, the Irish emigration, and the people flocking from East Germany to West Germany. All countries where BD deepened and then populism, instability and fundamentalism grew. In any case they are deforming our argument because we say that BD and populism feed of each other.", "The issue of the Third World and medicines and pharmaceutic patents has been dealt with in our 7th argument.", "Welcome to the third world, you might want to return home soon or as us, get used to it."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "Harms and more harms ", "argument": {"description": ["How do you know which country is richer? And does it matter which is the richer country? Going by the prop's own definition of BD as unacceptable, the answer would be no. If taking away a brain from another country that needs it is unacceptable, it shouldn't be acceptable if the country isn't the poorest or even poor. Doctors are a scarce resource and are needed everywhere. So why wouldn't all countries claim they need compensation? Do you need a doctor or nurse any less because you live in Europe? Many countries could ask for compensation if this is implemented as explained, they would only need to show that they are poorer than another where their people are migrating to. This would greatly complicate relations between countries.", "The prop. plan has all the potential to work as the intellectual colonialism they try to avoid. In this unilateral approach the richer country could offer the compensation that it determines as just for taking what it wants. This could bring some former Colonies very bad memories of olden times and create some friction. The poorer government doesn't decide the price because as they explain, if the poor country doesn't accept the compensation because it doesn't like the number or is offended by the compensation, the the doctor can leave (and send the postcard) and the rich country gives the money undermining the decision of the poor country. Not to mention the fact that, to get an idea of a real amount to offer the rich country would have to go into the poorer country's business to know data to base an offer on. This is both asymmetric and imperialistic. We blush just imagining the epithets Obama would get from Chavez if the first offered to pay Venezuela for all the MP that have migrated there, and how fast he would not only decry this offer as offensive while threatening to call his ambassador back from Washington, but offer to pay the heating costs for half a state in the US just to show off. Oh no, we are sorry, he already does that last thing. Well, he would find something.", "They say \"...brain drains, including the loss of medical personnel, take place between relatively rich countries provided the income disparity is wide enough. For example, rich Middle Eastern countries actively recruit doctors and nurses from Europe by offering high wages and low rates of taxation\". This example is given as proof that BDs have economical causes and the situation in the country doesn't play any role, but we didn't say that this phenomenon is only caused by any one  cause. There are some brain drains explained by improvements on salaries, as the example of Saudi Arabia and Europe. What we say is that there are other causes for BDs. Upon closer viewing, their example shows people take into account more than money. Contracts for MPs in Saudi Arabia last one or two years. To understand why so little we only needed to look at the answer to the question \"Can I take my family? (\"For nurses no, the contracts are single status\") to know why. And it's single female nurses since, as its explained,\"there are very limited posts for male nurses as Saudi Arabia is a Islamic society and males cannot nurse females or children on their own, there should be a female present.\"  [[http://www.nursinginsaudi.net/FAQs-FAQ--Working-as-a-nurse-in-Saudi-Arabia]] Of course people would leave Europe for Saudi Arabia for a year or two, maybe extend it if you are single. You can see it as a short adventure where you will see the world and make more money.  But this is not comparable to leaving your country forever, many times without your family and being bound to this new country in a draconian contract where you have to pay to leave. You come to a decision to leave when you balance what you will gain in money and life style with what you would loose in life style and nearness with loved ones. Most people wont leave Europe for Saudi Arabia forever if they can't take their children. And there is no money you can pay any one of us in team Venezuela to leave our (albeit hypothetical) children since we all feel we have enough to eat and to live a reasonably comfortable life here. But if we were to be able to take our children with us we may leave. We may stay in the current state of affairs, but anyone of us would leave if political persecution gets a lot worse and makes life here unbearable. That would be crossing our threshold and we would escape to save our lives, maybe leaving dear ones here.", "They inquire about our explanation of why \"the doctor or nurse who wishes to relocate has an obligation to the poorer country where they first trained (which the proposition have repeatedly proven does not exist on moral terms only on an economic one).\" We don't say they have an moral obligation, we observe they may be patriotic or otherwise attached to their environment and feel that they can use their knowledge to help their country and may feel an obligation.

If they do so after a year or two, they repay a proportion pro rata. Once they have 'worked off' the cost of the investment they become free agents\".

It would no longer be free if it comes with strings attached, medical staff are supposed to pay for their education by working their debt off or else pay for the remaining of their contract. Their system is an perverse and degenerate implementation of only allowing student loans for students of medical professions, since at least under a student loan scheme students know how much debt they are acquiring, and interest rates are regulated, these debts are even subject to bankruptcy law in some jurisdictions, the state acts as a guarantor of citizens rights against banks, but the efficiency of government funding is lost due to the cut the banks take for themselves, students however are free to emigrate or switch professions and jobs, provided they pay their loans with their new job or from their new location. There is a reason states choose to provide free education and it's that charging tuition fees, as a Scottish Education Minister once said, \"[prevents] young people from poor backgrounds going on to university for fear of getting into debt\"[[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1554455/Scotland-to-abolish-student-fees-despite-debts.html]].", "On the other hand under the Prop. scheme the burden of the contract would be placed upon the students, who are much more vulnerable than the state, the universities and the employers, since they have fewer monetary resources and thus access to legal counsel.

In colonial times people became indentured servants in exchange for a trade and a passage to the Americas or other colonies, and nowadays they propose to rescue this unfree labor practice, adapting it so people would be doing it for a career in medicine and an air ticket to the West instead. Just as people in debt bondage, indentured servants and slaves, they could be sold to new masters (in this case either countries or employers). The only way out of this brutal oppression is for the medical personnel to buy themselves out of the contract, a right they could hardly have been denied since even slaves were allowed to buy their own freedom.", "They finally deigned to clarify whether the compensation was paid to the home country before or after the personnel left the country by saying \"his new employers must reimburse the cost of this training in advance\". The thing is, enforcing these contracts means that the home and host countries have to be able to restrict the medical staff from leaving. Else they have no guarantee of compensation once they leave since sanctioning, embargoing or invading a richer nation seldom makes sense, and a medicine professional running off to a poorer country would be free -as a slave who escaped from the US South to a Northern state- because there would be no compensation to work off any more (since the Prop. plan is not a general migration compensation scheme, but rather a richer country compensates poorer country scheme).", "If no such measures are implemented then workers would just migrate as they do in the SQ and the plan would not make any significant difference whatsoever, except for driving immigration to a black market where the rule of law would be non-existent and migrants would be have to turn to smugglers and human traffickers to reach their dreamed destinations, and then suffer the hardships of being illegal aliens, and they would also be able to send less money back home, because of their immigration status.

Thus, the ability to design crops suited to specific climatic conditions is much more effective, and is beneficial to developing African countries. It also helps to control pests and fungal infections. GM crops have been modified to target specific types of pests like rootworm, unlike traditional pests which kill all kinds of insects without discrimination. They have been estimated to", "save on fuel", "because fuel is needed for farmers to operate machine spraying pesticides. This also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. In China for example, GM rice has made labour, energy consumption and costs reduce significantly because the amount of treatment normally required has reduced. This effect has compounded to a safer environment as less farmers are exposed to pesticides. The impact on other organisms like insects also decreases."], "reference": []}, "counter_argument": []}, {"perspective_title": "GMO in Medical Research", "argument": {"description": ["A majority of consumers are used to hearing about GMO application to food, but otherwise remain vastly unaware of its implementation in medical research. GMO is playing a massive role in the development of new medicine and treatment options. Scientists have been examining the effects of genetically modifying viruses and bacteria to target and destroy unhealthy cells in human beings. Gene therapy, which makes use of genetic modification, is fast becoming a viable treatment option for many people against many disorders including cancer. Many people suffering from anaemia are treated with a hormone (epoetin alfa), produced through genetic modification.
