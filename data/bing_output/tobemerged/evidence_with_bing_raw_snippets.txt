The atmosphere is the mixture of gases that surrounds Earth
The biosphere is the part of Earth where life exists
Then , at night the earth cools down
existing gases absorb the heat and maintain the optimum atmospheric temperature
The sun radiates energy in all directions
Clouds also produce their own greenhouse effect
The ground is receiving more direct sunlight and is therefore hotter
This heat is released into the atmosphere
